i
do
also

‚úmoney

and
as
an

i
was
able
to
express
my
thoughts

opinions
and
exercise
my
rights
and
ability
to
participate
fully
in

as

often
effectively
control

platinis

release

renewal
that
the

give

neither
perhaps
will
we
and
as
lower
prices
gripped
the
us
consumers
there
went
back
to
their
vehicles
in
droves
‚
so
demand
is
up
and
supply
is
down
and
as
mentioned
they
also
look
strong
in
goal
in
the
future
and
as
sfist
recently
noted
prop
i
would
also
have
the
consequence
of
killing
plans
to
turn
the
armorys
huge
drill
court
space
recently
fitted
with
a
new
floor
and
soundproofing
into
a
fulltime
concert
and
event
venue
and
as
some
of
us
grinches
reluctantly
get
dragged
kicking
and
screaming
into
the
holiday
cheer
i
was
called
upon
to
construct
a
list
of
the
things
black
people
must
know
this
holiday
season
and
as
soon
as
we
come
to
the
realization
we
all
bleed
red
breath
air
have
a
heart
and
a
soul
and
live
on
the
same
planet
we
can
all
work
together
to
squash
the
bullies
and
as
such
the
company
has
gone
to
great
lengths
in
order
to
keep
gluten
out
of
its
glutenfree
cheerios
and
as
the
mercury
news
reports
predictably
the
show
is
her
way
of
saying
she
never
felt
victimized
by
her
husband
but
she
does
feel
victimized
by
the
political
and
legal
system
and
as
the
white
races
numbers
decline
its
belief
in
reverse
discrimination
grows
and
as
we
started
to
pull
those
things
out
we
said
hey
that
would
be
interesting
next
to
that
and
at
percent
the
participation
rate
is
historically
very
low
and
at
devastation
today
and
at
some
point
a
goaltender
is
going
to
have
to
make
sure
the
deficit
doesnt
get
to
where
it
got
to
saturday
night

at
the
chikachan
riceball
cafe
further
inland
a
visit
from
japanese
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
and
the
womens
highquality
dishes
have
yet
to
ensure
financial
success
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
view
it
as
arizonas
efforts
to
pass
commonsense
laws
to
protect
preborn
children
and
their
mothers
have
been
successful
and
at
the
summit
of
the
americas
one
of
the
things
i
informed
president
pena
nieto
is
we
will
participate
but
we‚ll
insist
that
those
topics
are
on
the
agenda
and
banks
have
looked
at
whats
happened
in
kenya
and
have
decided
that
they
dont
want
to
see
that
happening
in
their
own
countries
and
because
booze
dehydrates
you
it
can
trick
you
into
thinking
you
need
food
when
your
body
is
really
calling
for
water
and
because
clients
are
criminalised
they
are
reluctant
to
leave
any
information
by
which
they
can
be
traced
and
because
of
ethical
and
cost
concerns
this
is
unlikely
to
happen
the
researchers
pointed
out
and
because
they
function
exclusively
over
the
web
online
banks
implement
strict
security
measures
to
keep
your
financial
data
out
of
the
hands
of
strangers
and
beijing
is
aware
of
the
serious
repercussions
from
the
sinking
of
the
sewol
ferry
in
south
korea

disaster
with
many
parallels
which
saw
the
prime
minister
resign
and
bofinger
raised
the
widely
ignored
fact
that
despite
endless
german
bellyaching
about
the
socalled
eu
drain
on
its
wealth
germanys
contribution
to
other
members
of
the
european

has
been
exactly
zero

and
bojangles
competitor
zaxbys
has
won
raves
from
many
chicken
fans
too
and
burundi
is
a
neighbor
of
rwanda
where
in
an
estimated
minority
tutsis
and
moderate
hutus
were
slaughtered
in
an
ethnic
genocide
and
by
several
unsuccessful
attempts
had
been
made

it

time
charles
h
duell
then

of
the
us
patent

declared
everything
that
can

has
been
invented
and
by
having
a
long
acting
safe
agent
onboard
like
a
therapeutic
antibody
what
we
are
able
to
do
is
prevent
that
initiation
from
firing
off
the
migraine
at
the
get
go
schatzman
said
and
certainly
more
topgirl
roles
have
appeared
in
recent
decades
as
women
found
more
chances
to
have
their
say
and
be
heard
and
chances
are
if
one
of
those
persons
died
in
custer
they
were
buried
in
boot
hill
cemetery
and
change
is
always
difficult
and
charbon

you
must
deal
with
all
of
the
above
while
at
the
same
time
keeping
symptoms
of
mental
illness
or
another
disability
under
control
and
for
good
reason
and
for
many
this
has
become
a
family
tradition
bringing
back
memories
of
the
good
ole
days
and
for
prenzo
her
daughter
is
one
of
those
who
are
not
vaccinated
‚
and
for
wexler
who
recently
authored
‚úall
bets
are
off
losers
liars
and
recovery
from
gambling
addiction‚
it‚s
no
longer
a
question
of
containing
sports
wagering
and
from
to
hertha
had
no
topflight
football
which
hampered
the
generational
transfer
of
support
says
uwe
bremer
of
the
berliner
morgenpost
and
from
the
bunker
holed
the
bunker
shot
to
make
a
five
and
gap
is
placing
a
big
bet
on
lululemon‚s
biggest
direct
threat
athleta
and
getting
that
story
to
the
public
has
not
been
easy
despite
the
fact
that
fifa
operates
under
the
olympic
charter
which
mandates
open
media
access
and
given
how
early
kings
endorsement
comes
in
the
cycle
he
traditionally
has
waited
until
quite
late
in
the
caucus
season
to
send
word
it
could
give
cruz
real
lift
in
organizing
northwest
iowa
where
king
lives
and
given
that
theyre
so
occupied
with
achieving
their
goals
it
makes
sense
that
they
would
be
more
likely
to
do
so
and
he
accused
gop
critics
of
violating
a
rule
in
american
politics
that
we
dont
play
fast
and
loose
on
important
foreign
policy
issues
and
hed
lower
climateharming
emissions
to
address
global
warming
and
he
has
won
five
senior
majors
which
is
tied
for
fifth
most
and
he
is
not
doing
much
to
hide
from
the
attention
launching
a
political
committee
this
week
to
help
him
travel
and
raise
money
as
he
considers
a
presidential
bid
and
he
never
told
anyone
what
happened
a
month
later
in
a
prisonerofwar
camp
in
the
heart
of
germany
and
he
ran
and
here
it
is
bushtrump
and
here‚s
apple
insider
on
the
same
topic
traffic
data
from
appleinsider
shows
that
visits
from
devices
that
appear
to
be
running
early
builds
of
ios
have
been
steadily
increasing
over
the
last
month
and
he
said
any
faith
can
be
twisted
by
humans
to
justify
acts
of
injustice
and
violence
and
he
should
know
what
he
is
talking
about
as
he
is
not
only
one
of
the
most
well
known
publishers
in
taiwan
but
has
also
been
head
of
the
taipei
book
fair
and
he
sought
to
expand
opportunity
for
all
the
president
said
and
hooper
points
the
finger
at
donald
trump
and
other
muslimbashers
advertisement
somebody
on
our
facebook
site
likened
whats
happening
to
lava
building
in
a
volcano
and
finally
erupting
he
told
nbc
news
and
however
the
chatter
has
leaned
on
selma
those
who
support
the
movie
should
be
grateful
that
there
is
chatter
at
all
carrying
the
movie
to
the
finish
line
and
how
many
times
has
this
story
been
repeated
and
how
will
you
approach
the
challenge
of
government
bureaucracies
where
workers
may
view
data
as
their
possession
not
the
publics
and
i
always
said
the
goal
of
mattachine
is
to
put
ourselves
out
of
business
and
i
cant
forget
the
image
of
those
isil
women
knocking
on
doors
in
mosul
looking
for
young
girls
to
be
brides
and
i
certainly
will
never
regret
living
here
and
i
cursorily
imagined
a
youngish
middle
manager
slumped
over
his
disorderly
workstation
in
a
depot
or
showroom
by
an
airport
somewhere
loosening
his
tie
as
he
pressed
the
hot
phone
to
his
reddened
ear
and
i
dont
know
why
im
still
standing
here
talking
to
you
and
i
dont
think
they
know
even
in
our
totally
technically
driven
economy
who
makes
this
stuff
how
it
got
here
and
if
a
highrisk
patient
suddenly
sits
up
an
alarm
sounds
and
if
i
know
joe
he
will
always
be
on
the
front
lines
always
fighting
for
all
of
us
and
i
find
it
amazing
actually
that
all
these
supposed
factcheckers
in
the
mainstream
media
claim
this
doesnt
exist
and
if
it
did
it
should
have
made
every
effort
to
find
it
quickly
and
if
it
hadn‚t
been
for
france
we
wouldn‚t
of
had
jazz
that‚s
for
sure
and
if
nature
is
kind
the
collisions
may
also
present
a
chance
to
look
at
dark
matter
and
if
someone
can
sell
them
thats
great
and
if
thats
lost
said
chairman
crocker
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
negative
thing
for
franklin
county
or
for
any
area
and
if
the
seahawks
want
to
pick
up
the
necessary
w‚s
going
forward
they‚re
going
to
have
to
be
smarter
and
if
they
say
they
can
get
things
made
cheaper
over
there
then
why
do
they
still
get
paid
like
kings
and
if
you
can
discover
a
new
planet
while
youre
at
it
you
could
also
be
pushing
the
boundaries
of
our
knowledge
and
if
you
eat
too
much
free
weight
watchers
meetings
and
if
you
have
anything
of
value
a
yard
sale
is
a
quick
way
to
make
a
nice
chunk
of
cash
and
if
you‚re
not
totally
comfortable
being
who
you
are
well
prince
isn‚t
a
bad
place
to
start
and
if
you
see
something
like
that
you
know
a
dog
is
starting
to
feel
the
heat
stress
‚
and
thats
pretty
serious
and
if
you
think
your
own
job
is
safe
think
again
and
if
you
want
action
try
flipping
a
coin
which
produces
the
same
exhilaration
of
any
of
the
game‚s
mechanics
and
i
guess
thats
why
i
closed
my
eyes
im
not
sure
and
i
hasten
to
add
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
i
have
told
my
husband
to
start
washing
the
leaves
and
i
just
kept
thinking
and
not
all
these
other
kids
and
i
have
to
need
them
place
and
i
know
god
will
take
care
of
it
and
im
also
going
to
go
ahead
and
assume
that
right
now
youre
not
making
the
money
or
the
difference
that
you
truly
want
to
be
making
and
im
a
young
boss
woman
and
im
over
here
calling
this
guy
to
find
out
if
hes
okay
and
hes
the
shooter
and
i‚m
positive
you‚ve
thought
about
it
and
im
sorry
it
took
so
long
but
you
know
life
happened
and
im
sure
thats
what
they
intended
to
do
and
in
a
court
filing
rebuffing
the
new
jersey
democrat‚s
bid
to
overturn
charges
against
him
prosecutors
revisit
uncharged
allegations
of
underage
prostitution
that
kicked
off
the
federal
probe
and
in
addition
to
these
three
victims
the
suspect
is
also
deceased
and
in
almost
all
cases
the
compensation
program
is
really
the
only
legal
option
available
to
people
injured
by
vaccines
and
in
a
new
ad
from
the
ndp
tom
mulcair
simply
says
im
ready
and
in
dunedin
new
zealand
on
saturday
a
vandal
spraypainted
a
swastika
on
a
headstone
and
knocked
over
two
others
breaking
them
in
the
jewish
section
of
the
southern
cemetery
the
new
zealand
herald
reported
and
in
europe
investors
are
still
waiting
for
more
news
on
whether
ab
inbev
bud
and
sabmiller
sbmry
will
merge
market
overview
us
stock
futures
are
sinking
and
the
overall
market
mood
is
muted
and
in
healthy
relationships
it
can
be
an
positive
force
in
our
lives
and
in
many
places
where
forests
used
to
grow
cities
and
industrial
areas
are
thriving
now
and
in
quiz
show
she
played
dorothy
van
doren
the
upright
mother
of
ralph
fiennes
charles
van
doren
again
clueless
to
her
sons
angst
and
instead
of
cutting
those
maintenance
prices
enterprise
vendors
are
doing
audits
and
other
routine
ball
busting
to
keep
customers
paying
up
for
old
products
and
in
terms
of
hits
thats
pretty
well
as
far
as
poor
stacy
got
and
in
that
time
what
would
have
been
a
lowkey
meeting
took
on
new
importance
and
in
the
cases
where
weve
not
provided
options
belfiore
went
on
to
say
we
feel
that
those
things
have
to
do
with
the
health
of
the
system
and
are
not
personal
information
or
are
not
related
to
privacy
and
in
the
eight
days
i
was
there
i
didnt
see
one
window
that
wasnt
shattered
and
in
the
hours
before
president
xi
arrives
for
the
nuclearpowered
pomp
of
a
state
visit
to
britain
what
can
we
glean
from
the
numbers
thats
of
relevance
to
us
and
investors
dont
always
prevail
in
arbitration
proceedings
and
i
read
the
paper
said
laethan
wene
and
i
remember
thinking
why
that
sound
and
i
said
have
you
noticed
this
phenomenon
and
isis
make
no
mistake
about
it
is
an
evil
in
this
world
and
i
suspect
wonderful
films
whose
titles
just
aren‚t
jumping
out
at
me
right
now
and
it
appears
that
it
could
go
on
for
quite
a
while
said
ken
volk
the
president
of
the
arizona
tenants
advocates
and
it
doesnt
look
quite
as
refined
as
a
promotional
image
of
the
same
machine
and
i
thank
you
for
your
friendship
and
your
counsel
and
all
of
us
thank
you
for
your
character
and
your
integrity
and
i
think
in
order
to
make
them
look
like
losers
we
have
to
destroy
their
caliphate
and
it
is
sturdy
enough
for
manager
lloyd
mcclendon
to
slot
paxton
into
sunday‚s
starting
spot
and
it
really
touches
me
that
everyone
is
coming
out
to
watch
and
its
a
nod
to
the
importance
of
china
where
customers
know
the
continental
name
and
appreciate
brands
with
a
rich
history
and
its
another
way
for
organizations
and
people
on
twitter
to
reach
a
global
audience
at
the
most
relevant
moments
and
its
likely
to
happen
again
in
and
its
much
different
when
you
read
about
it
and
its
not
just
during
the
holidays
and
it
starts
with
the
mother
and
it
took
an
actual
war
to
settle
the
slavery
argument
and
it
was
all
thanks
to
angel
tree
and
the
salvation
army
and
it
was
humbling
and
it
wasnt
just
the
regime
‚
the
public
shared
in
the
suspicion
of
yankee
imperialists
and
it
will
be
a
direct
upgrade
meaning
you
can
run
the
windows
installation
in
windows
or
and
you
should
end
up
with
windows
in
the
end
and
i
want
to
believe
it
she
said
from
seattle
and
i
was
getting
blisters
and
i
was
told
this
and
i
will
always
be
thankful
for
their
passion
and
expertise
he
said
and
jermaine
didnt
even
realize
hed
been
stabbed
he
came
in
saying
he‚d
been
hit
in
his
head
and
john
who
became
a
ceo
instead
of
a
pastor
said
his
father
was
the
most
remarkable
man
he
knew
and
just
as
congress
returns
from
its
august
recess
republicans
are
launching
fresh
attacks
against
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
keileys
staging
of
the
aftermath
of
humpty
dumptys
great
fall
is
a
bit
of
comic
brilliance
and
killing
and
displacing
innocent
civilians
is
the
best
advertisement
available
to
isis
recruiters
and
lets
bring
in
abc
news
chief
health
and
medical
editor
doctor
richard
baxter
think
its
so
much
for
joining
us
and
you
know
and
like
many
community
leaders
who
fear
that
the
coming
heat
waves
hurricanes
and
superstorms
will
overwhelm
their
neighborhoods‚
defenses
eisenhard
worries
that
the
plan
is
‚únot
very
strong
should
someone
attempt
to
implement
it‚
and
lyle
said
of
course
ive
been
your
father
for
years
im
going
to
keep
on
being
here
for
you
he
said
and
maybe
even
fired
and
maybe
some
daft
youtube
links
as
well
and
mickelson
could
become
the
secondoldest
winner
in
masters
history
after
jack
nicklaus
who
was
when
he
won
in
and
more
costly
eggs
have
in
turn
begun
causing
price
increases
everywhere
from
diners
to
bakeries
and
moscow
takes
advantage
and
much
of
the
bible
is
taken
up
by
the
same
theme
israel
is
constantly
disobeying
god
leading
it
into
all
sorts
of
trouble
but
god
never
wavers
from
his
end
of
the
covenant
and
my
mom
could
walk
with
me
but
every
time
the
police
went
by
she
would
drop
me
and
my
spanish
is
suitable
only
for
insulting
people
and
nancy
grace
isnt
happy
about
it
and
neither
mr
tsipras
nor
any
other
individual
leader
or
single
country
can
be
expected
to
contribute
to
such
a
policy
shift
without
quick
clear
and
strong
eu
and
social
alliances
and
never
pray
for
one
of
them
who
dies
nor
stand
at
his
grave
for
they
do
not
believe
in
allah
and
his
envoys
and
they
died
as
evildoers
supporters
of
wacht
auf
wake
up
a
salafist
group
in
offenbach
near
frankfurt
wrote
on
facebook
and
no
one
is
the
awkward
loner
standing
off
to
the
side
and
not
every
article
or
editorial
was
translated
in
both
languages
and
now
energia
hopes
to
build
an
offshore
wind
park
near
the
estonian
island
of
hiiumaa
about
kilometers
east
of
sweden
and
kilometers
south
of
finland
and
now
fire
agencies
stepping
up
to
help
those
who
lost
their
own
homes
as
they
worked
to
protect
others
and
now
he
was
sick
‚úand
now
it‚s
got
to
december
and
we‚re
in
the
last
week
we
can
basically
hear
the
governor
coming
down
the
corridor
and
he‚s
about
to
put
the
key
in
the
cell
door
to
take
you
to
meet
your
fate‚
he
said
and
now
mike
huckabee
has
picked
up
that
same
critique
scolding
beyonce
and
the
obamas
for
allowing
their
daughters
to
listen
to
the
pop
singer
and
now
schools
are
getting
in
on
the
act
university
of
washington
and
university
of
massachusetts
dormitory
and
dininghall
officials
announced
a
bet
of
their
own
friday
and
now
that
theyve
seen
this
video
carr
says
more
charges
are
likely
under
the
highway
traffic
act
and
the
criminal
code
and
now
the
wildcats
are
just
one
win
away
from
a
perfect
regular
season
and
now
we
know
where
they
buy
their
tools
from
a
tiny
italian
company
in
milan
and
now
your
contract
will
run
at
least
eight
years
and
number
three
even
getting
the
shelter
built
to
the
level
we
had
it
built
we
had
to
borrow
money
to
complete
construction‚
and
of
course
i
loved
the
dog
and
of
course
jesus
disdained
worldly
possessions
‚úit
is
hard
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven‚
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
god‚
and
of
course
our
greatest
ally
saudi
arabia
was
there
although
a
little
out
of
breath
having
just
days
ago
flogged
a
blogger
and
of
course
that
being
said
safe
sane
and
consensual
is
always
a
part
of
what
we
teach
and
of
course
wed
imagine
that
windows
will
be
a
big
part
of
microsofts
goodwill
initiative
and
one
of
them
is
that
i
dont
think
its
good
enough
just
to
talk
the
talk
on
campaign
finance
reform
and
one
of
the
other
two
worked
for
president
ronald
reagan
and
one
of
the
topics
being
discussed
is
medical
marijuana
and
one
thing
that
came
across
very
clearly
is
the
united
states
would
not
allow
us
to
say
that
we
were
satisfied
and
on
friday
the
program
drew
early
praise
from
maryland
democratic
rep
elijah
cummings
who
called
it
super
great
but
said
we
need
even
more
reforms
and
on
just
about
every
piece
of
downtownrelated
advertising
dtla
is
stamped
on
some
corner
and
only
then
after
being
informed
that
his
team
would
not
be
able
to
play
at
the
venerable
robert
f
kennedy
stadium
unless
he
complied
and
on
monday
ukrainian
president
petro
poroshenko
accused
russia
of
sending
large
shipments
of
military
aid
to
the
rebels
in
violation
of
a
february
peace
accord
and
on
the
other
there‚s
this
unknown
territory
of
baby
snakes
are
they
even
cute
who
aren‚t
unwrapped
so
much
as
they
are
liberated
in
this
terribly
organic
mess
of
blood
and
yolk
and
egg
shell
and
on
wednesday
twitter
said
it
was
partnering
with
us
retailers
to
help
them
sell
products
through

out

in

calmer
river
now
with
the
waves
she
was
concerned
about
him
and
she‚s
one
of
them
and
shes
subtly
resurrected
her
primary
attack
of
obamas
approach
to
world
affairs
taking
a
more
hawkish
stance
toward
russia
syria
and
iran
and
she
was
so
humble
and
a
very
giving
person
macdonald
said
and
short
interest
in
the
us
recently
reached
the
highest
since
the
financial
crisis
and
similarly
with
israel
israel
is
obviously
our
closest
ally
and
partner
in
the
region
and
since
sales
are
rising
its
not
a
stretch
to
expect
the
company
to
end
the
year
in
the
range
of
about
million
annually
and
skinny
people
arent
always
healthy
and
so
it
is
that
as
the
party
ends
everybody
leaves
with
jerry
hanging
on
his
every
word
and
so
its
just
pass
at
this
juncture
flanders
told
the
new
york
times
and
soldiers
had
been
able
to
reopen
two
private
radio
stations
that
had
been
closed
by
the
government
he
said
and
some
advice
from
someone
who
signed
their
name
as
david
lynch
in
keep
your
eye
on
the
donut
not
the
hole
and
some
candidates
left
no
doubt
about
what
their
campaigns
purchased
‚
and
had
plenty
of
spaces
to
spare
and
some
members
of
both
houses
remain
divided
on
the
position
to
be
taken
on
the
un
agreement
and
some
schools
in
the
most
disadvantaged
areas
are
actually
worse
off
because
of
cuts
in
other
areas
of
the
schools
budget
and
so
something
else
was
going
on
and
he
said
let‚s
do
it
in
la
and
so
you
begin
these
years
hoping
to
cope
to
survive
to
make
friends
that
last
you
a
lifetime
and
squares
have
one
additional
benefit
that
you
can
use
to
your
advantage
and
steps
to
improve
water
storage
during
wet
years
like
increasing
the
use
of
reservoirs
could
also
help
cook
said
and
still
another
i
prayed
so
hard
for
you
all
and
still
others
see
the
possibility
that
biden
could
become
a
spoiler
in
the
democratic
race
hurting
clinton‚the
candidate
they
believe
has
the
best
chance
of
success
against
any
republican
and
still
others
were
doubtful
about
the
millionaire
matchmaker
hookup
and
that
every
person
who
is
not
actively
working
against
that
structure
plays
a
complicit
role
in
upholding
it
and
that
gives
me
confidence
and
that
has
its
own
dangers
and
that
income
stream
is
another
thing
apple
stock
provides
that
google
does
not
and
thats
all
the
more
impressive
when
you
contemplate
how
easy
it
would
have
been
for
fresh
to
be
a
train
wreck
and
thats
divine
broussards
friend
shirley
williams
wrote
in
a
comment
her
on
broussards
facebook
page
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
sensible
approach
and
that‚s
exactly
what‚s
happened
and
thats
just
the
ground
level
and
thats
part
of
the
problem
says
shannon
and
thats
putting
it
mildly
and
thats
saying
a
lot
‚úand
that‚s
tainted
his
reputation
here
at
home‚
and
thats
what
ive
always
seen
and
thats
what
weve
done
and
thats
when
the
gloves
may
come
off
and
thats
when
they
may
start
asserting
themselves
i
am
a
boy
i
am
a
girl
god
made
a
mistake
that
sort
of
thing
and
then
the
parents
will
know
there
is
some
distress
going
on
here
because
the
brain
gender
identify
is
not
matching
the
birth
sex
and
that‚s
why
i
think
men
and
women
should
be
more
judicious
about
their
drinking
choices
and
thats
why
its
important
to
stand
up
to
bullies
wherever
they
are
and
thats
why
japanese
and
those
in
the
know
adore
it
and
that‚s
why
when
we
see
relationships
end
or
characters
die
it
hurts
and
the
barbecue
sauce
makes
a
sweet
spicy
and
tangy
flavouring
for
meat
and
the
biggest
cluster
by
far
was
a
group
of
seven
streets
southwest
park
ave
fourth
ave
sw
taylor
street
third
ave
sw
washington
street
sw
stark
street
and
sw
salmon
and
the
chicken
appeared
and
the
exclusion
of
this
group
from
health
reform
along
with
other
restrictions
that
affect
fully
legal
immigrants
as
well
could
create
a
massive
coverage
gap
that
puts
a
strain
on
the
rest
of
the
health
system
as
well
and
the
extremist
group
is
putting
a
particular
focus
on
girls
analysts
say
‚úand
the
flip
side
of
it
the
kind
of
anger
and
the
sense
of
outrage
that
comes
from
discovering
that
that‚s
not
the
truth
of
the
matter
that
gives
american
horror
films
in
some
ways
kind
of
an
additional
rage‚
and
the
hashtag
did
trend
‚
in
the
us
canada
and
worldwide
‚
by
monday
afternoon
and
the
instrument
of
your
revenge‚laws
that
require
hivpositive
people
to
disclose
to
their
sex
partners‚are
unjust
and
unworkable
and
the
job
had
to
be
done
fairly
and
the
last
time
this
possibility
was
explored
was
when
herbert
hoover
was
president
the
great
depression
was
in
full
swing
and
the
charles
lindbergh
baby
kidnapping
was
the
big
news
story
of
the
year
‚
and
the
media
plays
no
small
part
in
fueling
the
madness
and
the
money
eventually
arrived
even
if
it
had
to
be
transported
in
suitcases
and
then
by
grumbling
about
his
grandson
who
much
to
haydens
displeasure
likes
to
play
with
dolls
and
then
he
picks
the
targets
by
himself
organizes
his
attackers
and
executes
his
mission
and
then
i
played
a
loose
game
on
my
serve
with
the
new
balls
and
then
she
turned
bounding
away
unhurriedly
into
the
dim
evening
woods
and
then
the
second
issue
is
how
likely
is
it
that
they
are
going
to
get
there
said
claudi
and
then
the
state
the
german
state
to
care
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
refugees
went
way
beyond
all
possible
forecasts
and
still
worked
surprisingly
well
and
then
they
build
monuments
to
you
and
the
numbers
on
jeb
show
hes
closer
to
mike
huckabee
than
to
hillary
clinton
or
even
bernie
sanders
or
ted
cruz
and
then
we
also
have
for
members
and
then
youll
either
be
sold
or
youll
decide
it
doesnt
quite
fit
in
your
universe
and
then
you
move
on
to
a
sense
of
acceptance
of
it
and
the
past
wasnt
so
great
for
many
of
our
neighbors
‚úand
the
people
who
come
to
see
me
are
the
people
who
are
tired
of
being
afraid
and
the
pieces
on
display
include
some
gems
but
the
vast
majority
of
the
works
are
displayed
in
alienating
glass
cases
within
austere
rooms
and
the
protesters
seem
to
be
just
carrying
on
with
their
protests
and
the
reality
is
not
that
and
therefore
it
would
be
almost
suicidal
to
try
and
expand
volumes
to
the
detriment
of
that
relationship
and
there
is
that
change
in
atmosphere
that
everyone
is
talking
about
and
the
reports
from
the
front
shown
each
night
on
television
vaunting
the
success
of
the
russian
operation
in
syria
will
do
nothing
to
change
that
and
theres
a
lot
on
the
plate
of
an
executor
or
family
member
dealing
with
a
death
already
she
said
and
theres
a
touch
of
melancholy
gilgoff
said
and
theres
a
weird
sense
that
if
your
hero
sometimes
has
the
same
brain
processes
as
you
do
then
maybe
you
are
not
that
weird
and
will
be
okay
after
all
and
there‚s
lingering
concern
the
recent
slowdown
was
more
than
just
the
result
of
some
bad
weather
‚úand
theres
only
three
or
four
of
them
and
the
response
from
miss
piggy
and
there
was
no
traffic
scramble
to
help
pedestrians
cross
back
then
just
tommy
who
manages
to
quickly
gum
up
the
works
and
there
were
pending
sales
‚
mutual
purchase
agreements
that
haven‚t
closed
yet
‚
a
percent
jump
over
the
year
and
the
rsp
a
force
of
around
only
will
need
the
rest
of
the
military‚s
support
to
keep
control
of
the
country
and
the
shoe
was
sticking
inside
the
horses
side
she
said
and
the
sound
from
the
stage
was
surprising
crisp
even
on
the
upper
deck
and
the
supreme
leader
can‚t
say
‚òstop
shouting
this
phrase‚
because
he
is
the
essence
of
the
iranian
people‚
and
the
surface
pro
starts
at
more
and
the
uaw
provided
the
detroit
office
space
where
king
wrote
his
most
iconic
speech
i
have
a
dream
and
the
way
the
person
that
did
it
all
people
that
involved
know
who
did
it
is
and
i
hope
they
take
their
own
life
or
turn
themselves
in
said
the
brother
and
the
weather
company
has
boatloads
of
it
and
the
who
is
hoping
countries
that
may
have
grown
complacent
about
mers
are
taking
note
and
the
wisconsin
team
that
won
the
prize
the
last
two
years
is
fighting
to
defend
its
title
and
they
can
enable
amazing
new
pc
experiences
like
logging
into
your
computer
with
your
face
and
having
a
personal
assistant
respond
to
your
voice
and
they
can
say
yes
weve
got
handydart
in
place
yes
you
can
take
the
bus
but
i
mean
youre
inconveniencing
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
people
and
they
cant
have
you
back
and
they
dont
appear
to
be
a
massive
moneymaker
and
they
help
you
in
terms
of
things
like
eating
a
lot
of
bacon
and
they‚re
all
strong
looking
guys‚
said
trump
who
wondered
why
the
refugees
weren‚t
staying
and
fighting
for
their
county
and
theyre
arguably
topics
of
greater
importance
and
theyre
not
supposed
to
park
on
the
street
and
they
voted
massively
against
politicsasusual
in
last
years
european
parliamentary
polls
and
they
want
to
legalize
marijuana
and
thirdly
gangs
in
the
tricities
start
recruiting
young
and
this
is
why
i
love
the
idea
of
embracing
other
females
who
are
doing
what
im
doing
and
this
person
is
a
catholic
saint
and
this
year
it
grew
with
more
employers
wanting
to
be
a
part
of
it‚
and
those
are
solutions
that
can
actually
be
turned
into
economic
opportunities
instead
of
just
costs
and
those
numbers
will
come
even
as
the
company
expects
a
percent
to
percent
jump
in
sales
of
between
billion
to
billion
and
those
theories
run
the
gamut
and
those
wanting
to
document
their
mudik
in
pictures
can
download
instadeen
which
allows
users
to
add
religious
text
or
koranic
verses
to
their
photos
before
posting
them
online
and
though
his
car
was
found
in
the
restaurants
lot
hoffa
was
never
spotted
again
and
three
gave
million
and
thus
far
in
february
crude
oil
and
the
sp
have
enjoyed
a
huge
positive
correlation
of
with
indicating
perfect
correlation
‚úand
thus
it
really
wasn‚t
gorffwysfa
anymore
it
was
just
sussex
drive‚
and
to
be
honest
with
you
even
jesus
let
alone
you
would
have
also
tripped
in
that
kind
of
situation
he
said
and
to
those
candidates
thinking
they
have
time
to
catch
trump
by
ignoring
him
and
talking
policy
stop
kidding
yourself
and
unfortunately
we
dont
really
have
religious
scholars
who
can
stand
up
and
say
that
this
is
not
right
and
unlike
other
scifi
hit
movies
like
blade
runner
and
the
matrix
the
series
also
gives
fans
reason
for
optimism
and
unlike
the
sandcastles
you
may
have
built
in
your
youth
these
popup
palaces
have
windows
electricity
running
water
and
wifi
and
warren
buffet
learned
how
to
analyze
business
from
his
business
partner
charlie
munger
and
watch
cbc
aboriginal
for
a
feature
article
on
the
language
house
‚úand
we
believe
that
there
is
more
that
can
be
done
if
countries
are
willing
to
contribute
additional
resources‚
and
we
can
look
at
these
issues
more
calmly
said
peter
swire
who
served
on
a
review
panel
appointed
by
president
barack
obama
after
former
contractor
edward
snowdens
revelations
of
vast
nsa
surveillance
and
we
can
not
let
that
happen
and
we
could
create
benefits
for
people
and
salmon
and
we
encourage
all
people
to
come
down
and
we
have
allowed
ourselves
to
be
tempted
and
we
have
bunked
off
and
we
just
ran
as
fast
as
we
could
and
we
know
that
not
talking
about
racism
doesnt
make
it
disappear
and
we
must
square
our
shoulders
to
the
great
challenge
of
climate
change
and
make
this
threat
our
opportunity
and
we
need
to
move
on
the
all
three
main
tracks
political
settlement
security
and
humanitarianeconomic
issues
and
were
looking
at
a
quick
knockdown
on
a
fire
jetter
said
and
we‚re
very
different
and
we
see
the
same
story
through
the
eyes
of
her
mother
who
is
flawed
but
who
has

although
we
dont
like
to
talk

at

of

many
pundits
considered
the

all

when

microchip
was
scanned
his

were
identified
and
the

was
arranged
for
the
following
day
and
when
i
saw

i
said
im
going
to
do
dollmaker
as
a

and
when
randy
is
out
there
this
is
really
important
to

he
has
the

it

a

adds

when

that
opens

youre

remains
elusive

killings
such

continue

also

they
and

will
have
many
reasons
to
feel

while

the

to

we
to
argue
with
that
and
who
wouldn‚t
‚
he‚s
undercutting

why
do

fight
over
the

what
they

while
grabbing
everyone
else‚s
right
to

too
and
why
dont
we
put
back
the
historic
streetcars
that
used

and
further
restrict

and
why

for

and
why
so
many

that

were

thursday

widespread
confusion
remains
on

with

falling

away
on

pennsylvania

worst
of

is
that

a

prerequisite
for

another
act
of

for

another

he

another

another

another
could
be
that

another
example
and
a

in
point
that
the
size
of
the

matters
little
to
our

to

so

felt
in
the

in

tehran
to
show
dissatisfaction
with

another
factor
may
be
that
people
with
nonaca

are
less
aware
that
those
preventive

said
kharraz
whereas
people
with

another

for

a

after
all
to
me
she
was
not
a

after
a

exciting

of

against

countries
and

teams
such
as

and
costa
rica
haiti
was
unable
to
win
the
three

secure

to

but
after
being
caught
overcharging
some
customers
in
new
york
and
california
by
selling
products
incorrectly
labeled
for
weight
it
lands
on
the
naughty
list
for
but
after
days
of
debate
the
groups
said
late
on
wednesday
they
had
not
managed
to
agree
on
a
leader
and
would
take
different
paths
in
respect
to
the
matter
of
a
presidential
candidate
but
after
driving
south
towards
baghdad
is
then
turned
its
attention
to
the
kurds
pushing
them
back
toward
their
regional
capital
arbil
in
a
move
that
helped
spark

but
a
lot
of

victims
thought
the

was
years
too
late
he
added
but
always
from
the
safety
of
his
regular
seat
on
the
back
row
of
the
labour
benches
but
an
agreement
was
struck
between
finance
minister
moshe
kahlon
and
histadrut
chairman
avi
nissenkorn
just
three
hours
before
the
walkout
was
set
to
begin
but
a
new
study
proves
the
practice
also
puts
monkeys
at
risk
of
picking
up
internal
bugs
gastrointestinal
parasites
but
an
octopus
has
no
such
rhythm
in
its
coordination
the
researchers
said
but
any
prospect
of
significant
cooperation
was
extinguished
months
later
when
then
us
president
george
w
bush
dubbed
iran
part
of
an
axis
of
evil
arming
to
threaten
the
peace
of
the
world
but
a
political
row
between
kiir
and
his
sacked
deputy
machar
descended
into
fighting
inside
the
country
in
december
often
along
ethnic
faultlines
but
a
presidential
campaign
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
we
should
respect
them
for
persevering
however
remote
the
odds
should
be
he
argued
but
a
recent
message
from
nra
executive
vice
president
wayne
lapierre
to
nra
members
makes
clear
where
the
group
stands
but
a
remarkable
amount
of
its
energy
is
devoted
to
creating
an
alternative
idealized
version
of
itself
online
and
shaping
how
that
virtual
empire
is
perceived
but
as

as

a

soon
followed

as
he

with
his
late

predecessor
david
letterman
he
can
now
tuck
that
ear
inside

and
pop
it
free
at

but
as
his

neared

he
slowed
down
a
little
and
was
nearly
caught
but
aside
from
obvious

theres
a
bigger

itunes

but
asked
in

if
he
would

obama
said
let
me
take
a
look
comprehensively
at
the
ideas
that
they
present
but
ask
most
americans
to
name
their
top
three
formula
drivers
and
you‚ll
be
greeted
by
stumped
expressions
but
as
much
as

to
get
this
done
quickly
its
more
important
to
get
it
right
will
stelle
regional
administrator
of
noaa
fisheries
west
coast
region
said
in
a
statement
but
as
naomi
conrad
reports
from
cairo
amid
a
climate
of
intimidation
and
repression
many
are
boycotting
the
elections
but
a
spokesman
for
the
state
department
mark
toner
insisted
that
simply
trying
to
find
ways
to
avoid
the
forces
bumping
into
one
another
in
the
war
zone
does
not
imply
a
renewal
of
military
ties
but
as
princebythewood
says
the
studios
should
open
the
door
for
women
who
are
in
love
with
film
and
with
storytelling
but
asset
managers
with
good
records
of
evaluating
future
asset
class
performance
such
as
grantham
mayo
van
oterloo
gmo
in
boston
think
international
and
emerging

stocks
are
cheaper
than
us
stocks
currently
but
as
someone
whos
been
trying
to
make
a
threepointer
while
standing
still
for
the
last
something
years
and
failing
every
time
i
cant
help
but
be
impressed
by
the
ease
with
which
curry
makes
the
shot
but
as
speakers
at
the
transport
forum
in
leipzig
have
noted
it
is
ultimately
the
responsibility
of
governments
to
provide
and
promote
viable
alternatives
to
conventional
travel
but
as
technology
advances
its
becoming
harder
and
harder
to
do
but
as
the
rest
of
life
moves
online
so
too
do
real
estate
sales
in
ever
more
expensive
offerings
but
as
voters
get
to
know
him
he
said
he
expects
to
win
them
over
precisely
because
he
is
the
‚úantimainstream‚
‚úantistatus
quo‚
‚úantiincumbent‚
candidate
but
a
tall
lifesized
portrait
hung
prominently
above
her
living
room
mantel
a
young
man
in
a
confederate
uniform
and
with
a
sword
but
at
least
he‚ll
be
able
to
say
he
went
down
fighting
but
at
least
part
of
that
brand
has
thus
far
suggested
her
support
for
the
lgbt
community
but
at
present
the
ecigarette
industry
is
not
regulated
and
so
there
is
no
long
term
data
to
reassure
users
about
the
safety
of
the
products
but
at
some
point
their
mother
got
into
a
drug
treatment
program
and
eventually
the
girls
went
home
but
at
some
point
the
seahawks
must
find
that
next
wave
of
young
players
to
remain
successful
but
at
the
end
of
that
season
penniless
ebbsfleet
were
relegated
back
to
conference
south
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
cant
keep
thinking
about
results
she
said
but
at
the
heart
of
give
me
your
skin
is
our
deep
femalemale
friendship
emphasising
the
notion
that
the
best
remedy
for
men
feeling
trapped
by
their
masculinity
is
to
learn
from
their
fellow
humans
women
but
at
the
same
time
i
have
nothing
to
hide
but
at
the
sight
of
a
child
in
a
wheelchair
close
to
the
security
barrier
the
yearold
argentine
pontiff
got
out
of
the
car
and
walked
over
to
bless
the
child
but
at
the
un
he
signaled
that
the
church
was
not
ready
to
champion
transgender
rights
an
issue
of
growing
importance
in
the
united
states
as
gay
equality
becomes
mainstream
but
australia
is
required
to
finance
it
entirely
pandjaitan
was
quoted
saying
in
the
jakarta
post
but
australia
will
take
some
comfort
in
losing
rather
than
in
captain
michael
clarkes
last
test
but
basically
the
multinational
corps
is
supposed
to
show
that
we
can
do
it
but
batman‚s
going
to
have
to
put
aside
his
animosity
toward
his
uninvited
guests
because
he‚s
about
to
have
his
first
runin
with
their
deadliest
enemy
shredder
but
because
the
judge
didnt
explicitly
order
the
schools
open
the
school
district
says
it
will
keep
them
closed
but
behind
closed
doors
hegedus
says
her
message
will
be
clear
but
being
the
gentleman
farmer
that
he
was
he
started
to
offer
help
but
beneath
feldheims
lone
street
runs
a
network
of
electrical
cables
and
heating
pipes
powered
entirely
by
renewable
energy
but
beyond
that
i
didn‚t
know
much‚
but
beyond
the
tough
talk
and
calls
for
action
there
was
little
indication
of
how
leaders
intended
to
escalate
the
assault
on
the
extremist
group
but
boehner
could
point
to
almost
nothing
else
that
happened
on
his
watch
because
the
tea
party
would
tolerate
nothing
else
but
brazilian
financial
daily
valor
quoted
chinese
ambassador
and
former
viceforeign
affairs
minister
li
jinzhang
as
saying
that
the
overdependence
on
commodity
trade
could
not
continue
and
needed
to
be
transformed
on
a
wider
scale
but
buckett
says
that
doesnt
mean
that
they
are
being
rushed
to
ivf
but
bullets
are
not
the
silver
bullet
ban
said
but
burying
the
lab
a
mile
deep
in
the
earth
is
the
only
way
to
shield
experiments
from
the
interference
of
the
suns
cosmic
rays
she
said
but
by
analysts
expect
india
to
become
the
worlds
thirdlargest
passenger
vehicle
market
after
china
and
the
united
states
but
by
last
year
that
dropped
to
nine
states
but
by
then
the
buyer
had
walked
away
but
by
the
time
that
microorganism
invades
all
the
organs
and
takes
over
your
dog
is
really
at
risk
for
death‚
adams
said
but
cabell
county
ems
director
gordon
merry
said
the
problem
is
now
spreading
to
all
corners
of
the
county
but
californians
are
trying
hard
to
conserve
their
water
but
canadian
medical
authorities
are
far
from
assigning
such
a
high
efficacy
rate
to
the

but
can
you
find
your
next
home
in

to
move
once

castro
later
delivered
a
searing
defense
of
venezuela
at
an
emergency
meeting
of
leftist
latin
american
governments
called
in
response
to
us
sanctions
levied
on
seven
venezuelan
officials
last
week
but
celebratory
beans
and
cornbread
another
part
of
the
tradition
were
not
the
only
element
that
carlson
added
to
the
countdown
but
certain
people
choose
to
interpret
islam
in
a
way
that
does
hold
women
back
but
china
is
aiming
for
pole
position
in
the
knowledge
economy
not
the
sweat
shop
economy
but
chon
said
park
placed
her
name
on
shell
companies
and
bank
accounts
for
uwaydah
and
attended
weekly
meetings
where
the
doctor
and
others
discussed
ways
to
hide
his
assets
from
insurers
creditors
and
law
enforcement
but
christopher
enns
who
runs
a
halifax
medical
marijuana
shop
isnt
sure
the
anticipated
new
laws
will
change
much
for
him
but
church
said
staying
in
a
boarding
home
without
her
partner
for
the
remaining
weeks
of
her
pregnancy
is
not
an
emotionally
safe
option
for
her
but
collins
said
chimp
haven
only
has
slots
open
right
now
but
conservative
support
has
risen
compared
to
when
just
percent
of
the
party
believed
that
trade
pacts
boost
the
us
economy
but
consumers
are
wary
and
lack
confidence
in
governments
readiness
to
regulate
this
new
class
of
food
product
researchers
and
activists
say
but
cooperation
interaction
and
a
networked
approach
are
missing
factors
but
critics
of
the
boundary
dam
project
argue
that
it
doesnt
effectively
address
environmental
concerns
because
it
justifies
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
but
croatia‚s
interior
minister
ranko
ostojic
insisted
that
the
opposite
was
true
and
slovenia
was
dragging
its
heels
in
accepting
people
quickly
enough
but
cutting
out
all
carbs
isnt
but
daragh
mcdowell
principal
analyst
on
europe
and
central
asia
for

consultancy
verisk
maplecroft
said
the
kremlin
will
want
to
minimise
the
adverse
publicity
arising
from
combat
or
other
losses
in
terms
of
the
russian
domestic
audience
but
day‚s
spokesman
said
he
did
officiate
weddings
for
straight
couples
between
may
and
september
of
when
he
stopped
doing
weddings
altogether
with
the
exception
of
one
for
a
straight
couple
in
march
of
this
year
but
delta
airlines
told
kabc
a
cnn
affliliate
that
it
needed
to
get
olearys
plane
to
new
yorks
la
guardia
airport
for
flights
later
in
the
day
but
deluca‚s
mournful
singing
is
solid
and
‚úwatch
what
happens‚
the
typewriter
ballad
for
katherine
stephanie
styles
is
easily
the
best
of
the
new
tunes
but
democratic
rival
hillary
clinton
who
is
trying
to
use
the
climate
issue
as
a
wedge
against
republican
candidates
praised
obamas
plan
and
said
id
defend
it
but
democrats
complained
that
a
number
of
these
temporary
tax
breaks
were
designed
to
give
a
shortterm
boost
to
the
economy
and
would
lose
their
punch
if
made
permanent
but
denniston
created
his
own
website
and
blog
last
month
saying
he
would
begin
posting
items
there
about
the
high
court
while
continuing
to
write
for
scotusblog
but
descriptions
of
the
other
two
deaths
at
the
marathon
and
the
death
of
a
police
officer
at
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
will
come
soon
but
despite
a
bank
of
canada
rate
cut
earlier
this
month
the
business
outlook
is
still
lacklustre
but
despite
bradys
own
circumstances
he
offered
no
advice
for
manning
but
despite
the
new
measures
earlier
officials
stressed
that
the
country
would
still
accept
refugees
through
its
official
border
crossings
but
did
you
know
but
differences
over
the
tactics
used
are
already
emerging
but
dissent
within
the
agency
was
widespread
said
the
first
government
source
but
does
going
to
dreamforce
count
but
dont
come
home
with
leftovers
but
downsizing
is
harder
than
it
looks
but
do
you
know
where
the
majority
of
news
discovery
comes
from
but
dr
gupta
can
be
very
persuasive
and
convinced
me
it
was
important
because
it
might
in
some
way
educate
others
but
due
to
the
fact
that
were
dealing
with
people
with
disabilities
‚
some
of
them
multiple
barriers
or
disabilities
‚
were
not
able
to
get
those
numbers
but
during
holts
third
and
fourth
weeks
on
the
job
the
gap
has
been
but
during
our
time
at
gw
they
do
so
much
more
but
during
winter
storm
juno
new
yorkers
showed
us
that
theyre
warmhearted
people
whove
got
one
anothers
backs
but
each
of
these
spectacles
offers
its
own
special
kind
of
stcentury
circus
experience
but
ebay‚s
also
kept
it
on
a
live
withinyourmeans
budget
which
has
only
tightened
since
the
announced
restructuring
but
economic
conditions
for
people
in
the
rest
of
north
korea
remain
dire
according
to
international
humanrights
groups
but
energy
industry
advocates
said
the
revision
makes
obamas
mandate
even
more
burdensome
costly
and
difficult
to
achieve
but
equally
important
is
taking
responsibility
for
creating
a
just
peace
in
a
postwar
syria
but
euro
zone
chairman
jeroen
dijsselbloem
immediately
warned
that
a
plebiscite
could
further
delay
the
implementation
of
reforms
and
hence
the
aid
disbursements
but
even
as
interest
rates
plunge
money
held
as
debt
also
becomes
worth
more
so
borrowers
crack
under
its
weight
but
even
as
the
pnp
factions
lock
horns
on
the
issue
there
is
the
feeling
on
the
ground
that
east
portland
has
not
got
its
opportunity
to
shine
because
of
poor
political
leadership
over
the
many
decades
but
even
at
what
was
considered
the
thbest
restaurant
in
the
world
guests
would
sometimes
ask
a
question
that
almost
anyone
who
works
for
tips
has
been
asked
before
so
what
do
you
really
want
to
do
but
even
bush
supporters
acknowledge
that
he
needs
to
improve
his
game
but
even
if
the
government
doesnt
bail
out
every
floundering
business
but
leaves
them
at
the
mercy
of
the
market
there
is
unlikely
to
be
a
property
market
crash
such
as
the
one
that
hit
the
us
in
the
last
decade
but
even
in
a
city
that
has
seen
more
homicides
than
sunrises
this
year
the
yearold‚s
killing
was
its
own
kind
of
horror
but
even
kant
who
bore
no
particular
affection
for
animals
acknowledged
that
he
who
is
cruel
to
animals
becomes
hard
also
in
his
dealings
with
men
but
even
skeptics
like
shakya
acknowledge
that
without
its
intervention
the
disparities
between
the
development
in
tibet
and
in
china
would
be
even
greater
but
even
stripping
qatar
of
the
cup
would
prove
difficult
but
even
there
on
the
cusp
of
innocence
the
lacey
bodice
is
transparent
leaving
valli
to
strategically
place
stars
and
hearts
to
conceal
nipples
but
eventually
a
man
driving
by
on
another
road
saw
her
but
eventually
as
hiring
increased
and
economic
growth
strengthened
more
consumers
replaced
their
old
clunkers
but
even
with
her
shocking
appearance
her
will
to
live
was
palpable
‚úbut
even
with
the
music
subliminally
it‚s
crowd
noise
but
every
day
prices
are
going
up
she
said
but
everything
changed
in
when
crippled
by
back
pain
that
forced
him
out
of
a
tournament
in
florida
he
underwent
back
surgery
in
the
form
of
a
microdiscectomy
but
experts
say
china
lacks
direct
access
to
the
afghan
taliban
and
relies
on
its
clout
over
pakistan
but
experts
say
this
lawsuit
is
bringing
up
a
lot
of
interesting
issues
but
fatigue
is
a
real
thing
but
fears
about
the
health
of
the
chinese
economy
buffeted
global
stock
markets
this
month
and
pushed
prices
of
oil
and
other
commodities
lower
but
feldman
doubted
whether
silvers
arrest
would
make
the
situation
much
worse
since
most
voters
are
more
focused
on
breadandbutter
issues
but
first
the
sculptures
made
in
south
wales
have
been
shipped
back
and
forth
to
scores
of
artists
in
locations
from
dorset
to
aberdeen
but
for
years
before
the
storm
the
organ‚s
unequaled
power
and
tonal
range
represented
the
pinnacle
of
the
art
form
ball
said
but
for
asylumseekers
its
an
interim
home
but
for
all
that
it
is
continually
exploited
but
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
but
for
a
republican
to
win
the
gap
in
party
membership
means
their
voters
need
to
show
up
at
a
much
higher
rate
than
democratic
voters
but
for
as
rich
as
this
city
is
what‚s
notable
is
how
little
money
there
is
in
city
politics
but
for
barry
zito
and
tim
hudson
who
were
both
apart
of
the
big
three
in
oakland
but
for
lebel
that
is
a
desperate
local
response
that
will
only
delay
things
but
for
many
irish
fans
those
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
after
argentina
secured
a
deserved
win
at
the
millennium
stadium
in
cardiff
but
for
me
working
in
the
garden
has
been
a
healing
place
but
for
shaalu
who
only
gave
her
working
name
aids
budget
cuts
and
condom
shortages
are
a
double
shock
she
last
received
her
rupees
monthly
salary
for
promoting
safe
sex
as
a
peer
educator
in
april
but
for
the
time
being
it
seems
like
the
us
has
quieted
down
but
for
this
event
the
calgary
philharmonic
orchestra
accompanying
the
film
with
a
live
full
orchestra
but
for
those
of
us
who
hope
and
expect
to
talk
more
openly
about
sex
with
our
children
than
our
parents
did
with
us
should
we
consider
sharing
our
own
sexual
experiences
with
them
but
for
us
it
did
impact
our
profits
but
franklin
says
that
in
many
cases
the
desire
to
change
jobs
doesn‚t
arise
from
such
an
unexpected
jolt
but
is
more
insidious
but
free
file
alliance
members
have
struck
individual
agreements
with
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
that
do
allow
for
free
filing
but
friends
say
its
hard
to
believe
espinosa
and
vera
an
activist
who
had
organized
protests
in
veracruz
would
be
tortured
and
killed
because
they
simply
were
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
but
geoengineering
researcher
andrew
lockley
isnt
convinced
by
the
stat
saying
that
would
require
an
extraordinarily
broad
definition
of
abuse
but
getting
more
done
in
less
time
will
give
you
more
time
to
focus
on
whatever
it
is
that
really
matters
to
you
but
going
one
step
further
for
me
personally
i
think
elastigirl
is
one
of
the
greatest
mom
characters
to
ever
grace
the
screen
live
action
or
animation
but
good
character
can
also
be
used
to
describe
someone
who
refrains
from
going
to
the
pub
in
order
to
revise
or
finish
their
work
project
but
groups
appealed
and
a
county
hearing
examiner
in
february
ruled
a
full
review
was
needed
but
gun
lock
requirements
and
smart
guns
have
been
vehemently
opposed
by
the
national
rifle
association
and
its
allies
but
half
of
the
wealthiest
schools
were
state
schools
led
by
the
universities
of
texas
california
and
michigan
but
happy
to
move
onto
the
next
adventure
but
harris
said
its
irresponsible
to
blame
the
deaths
of
officers
on
antipolice
protesters
or
those
spouting
strong
rhetoric
but
harris
said
that
the
trial
comes
to
an
end
in
midnovember
potentially
putting
a
question
mark
over
the
use
of
the
vaccine
beyond
that
date
but
have
you
fallen
into
the
habit
of
overpaying
by
buying
more
house
or
car
than
you
can
afford
but
hawkins
got
a
tip
from
someone
he
calls
‚úan
insider‚
that
brett
was
going
to
play
in
a
road
game
against
the
angels
he
was
able
to
get
to
anaheim
where
brett
had
a
fourhit
day
to
reach
the
magic
number
but
he
added
it
is
unrealistic
to
think
the
gulf
will
help
him
restore
relations
with
the
west
but
he
added
that
none
of
the
searching
ships
had
detected
any
pings
the
locator
signals
the
black
box
should
transmit
after
a
crash
but
he
added
the
parking
enforcement
officer
wouldnt
have
known
the
circumstances
and
has
to
follow
the
law
but
healey
had
one
very
unlikely
admirer
margaret
thatcher
but
he
also
told
delegates
that
on
this
issue
of
illegal
migration
of
boat
people
you
can
not
single
out
my
country
but
he
and
his
writing
are
full
to
brimming
with
whatever
you
can
think
of
as
antonym
to
rot
but
he
at
least
hopes
biello
will
be
in
the
job
for
at
least
the
next
three
years
but
he
became
enraged
after
the
kennedys
coldshouldered
him
over
alleged
ties
long
a
matter
of
dispute
with
the
mafia
and
sinatra
by
the
s
grew
close
to
ronald
reagan
but
he
cleared
cnns
threshold
for
tuesday
but
he
concluded
that
the
alleged
victim
was
not
reliable
either
so
it
could
not
be
proved
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
mr
wong
really
did
what
was
alleged
but
he
doesnt
plan
to
have
the
australians
take
the
same
approach
but
he
found
a
swing
thought
on
the
practice
range
saturday
morning
and
hit
the
ball
so
well
that
he
shot
despite
missing
four
putts
inside
feet
‚úbut
he
had
a
huge
game
because
of
the
guys
up
front
but
he
had
also
become
wary
of
what
he
saw
as
athens
efforts
to
stoke
resentment
particularly
following
the
unflattering
caricatures
of
him
printed
in
leftist
greek
newspapers
but
he
has
not
named
the
exact
date
yet
amid
uncertainty
about
the
outcome
of
the
negotiations
and
when
they
will
conclude
but
he
implied
they
were
there
to
help
the
assad
regime
adding
if
its
a
matter
of
pouring
gasoline
on
the
civil
war
in
syria
that
is
certainly
not
productive
from
our
point
of
view
but
he
insisted
iran
should
not
face
especially
farreaching
measures
but
he
keeps
his
private
life
largely
to
himself
and
there
are
very
few
pictures
of
baziana
but
he
left
an
foot
birdie
putt
woefully
short
on
the
th
hole
came
out
of
a
foot
birdie
putt
on
the
th
hole
and
left
another
birdie
putt
from
about
feet
short
on
the
next
hole
but
he
lost
favour
after
the
invasion
when
much
of
his
information
regarding
saddam
husseins
alleged
possession
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
links
to
alqaeda
turned
out
to
be
false
but
he
must
sink
his
putt
to
extend
the
playoff
but
he
noted
prosecutors
dont
believe
tutko
intended
to
kill
the
boy
but
he
noted
volatility
is
not
something
thats
sustainable
but
he
only
spent
about
a
year
there
but
he
predicted
two
challenges
ahead
but
he
probably
shouldnt
have
treated
it
like
a
pool
full
of
liquor
and
dived
in
it
but
her
campaign
miscalculated
the
staying
power
of
the
issue
and
the
various
investigations
it
would
spawn
but
heres
why
the
commercial
is
disingenuous
and
hypocritical
but
he
revealed
the
umpires
threatened
to
make
it
incomplete
but
her
experience
shook
her
confidence
but
her
younger
sister
vesla
and
their
friend
shyama
rose
were
still
within
the
year
limit
but
he
said
solving
the
problems
is
going
to
require
a
broader
political
movement
that
addresses
problems
like
poor
education
drugs
absent
fathers
and
limited
job
opportunities
but
he
said
that
he
believes
the
‚úresolution
of
this
matter
at
this
time
is
in
the
state‚s
best
interest‚
but
he
said
yassine
labidi
was
one
of
the
two
gunmen
killed
at
the
museum
but
he
says
how
the
team
manages
those
distractions
is
what
matters
most
but
hes
definitely
not
seeing
this
feminazi
agitprop
after
what
he
saw
in
the
trailers
charlize
theron
kept
showing
up
a
lot
in
the
trailers
while
tom
hardy
mad
max
seemed
to
have
cameo
appearances
but
he
struggled
last
season
collecting
six
goals
one
at
even
strength
and
assists
in
games
but
he
was
extremely
cautious
about
handing
over
distribution
to
a
third
party
and
being
subject
to
its
decisions
on
how
to
prioritise
content
but
he
was
just
a
gun
for
hire
on
that
movie
and
has
no
power
over
that
but
he
was
just
better
but
he
was
never
able
to
move
up
the
ladder
in
indy
cars
and
instead
made
a
move
to
nascar
that
initially
shut
the
door
on
his
chances
to
race
at
the
brickyard
but
hines
died
young
at
fiftyseven
of
liver
cancer
but
his
downbeat
measured
tone
was
in
contrast
to
lavish
praise
for
the
agreement
from
pragmatic
president
hassan
rouhani
and
his
westerneducated
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
but
his
eagerness
to
find
some
area
of
compromise
with
republicans
in
the
form
of
trade
policy
risks
undermining
all
his
other
plans
but
his
physical
state
is
not
really
good
but
his
potential
candidacy
is
coming
as
a
surprise
to
many
in
a
country
that
has
been
roiled
by
the
war
in
syria
next
door
and
that
has
seen
major
efforts
in
recent
years
to
reduce
longstanding
syrian
influence
but
his
struggles
with
difficult
questions
about
governance
have
made
that
confidence
harder
to
credit
but
home
and
business
owners
who
spoke
at
the
meeting
appeared
to
be
firmly
opposed
to
the
proposal
‚úbut
honestly
the
ph
in
most
of
these
beers
is
similar
to
a
white
wine
and
we
don‚t
say
sour
when
we
talk
about
wine‚
but
horizonal
scrolling
should
be
limited
as
it
forces
you
to
have
to
constantly
swipe
across
the
screen
but
how
did
it
end
up
in
the
state
but
how
does
the
data
know
where
to
go
and
can
it
get
lost
or
stolen
along
the
way
but
how
important
is
singapore
to
india
but
how
seattle
uses
graham
figures
to
be
under
the
microscope
all
season
but
how
to
achieve
it
is
a
different
matter
masamichi
told
the
associated
press
but
i
am
afraid
that
my
short
time
in
kashmir
was
rocked
by
a
dangerous
pattern
of
military
curfews
and
citywide
strikes
but
i
am
sure
that
the
porsche
engineers
will
find
an
appropriate
solution
but
i
and
many
other
yemenis
feel
a
deep
sense
of
pain
when
we
see
the
destruction
of
our
heritage
places
that
we
want
to
share
with
the
world
but
i
can
do
them
so
quickly
its
very
little
time
investment
but
i
can
tell
you
that
not
only
do
i
not
support
legalization
of
marijuana
it
is
not
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
currently
to
support
legalization
nor
would
it
be
the
position
if
i
were
confirmed
as
attorney
general
but
i
cant
imagine
that
this
will
be
the
last
we
hear
of
the
issue
but
identity
is
precisely
why
the
countless
contributions
to
the
american
story
economic
and
otherwise
by
anyone
not
white
and
male
go
largely
unheralded
in
our
collective
historical
memory
but
i
dont
think
the
government
will
bring
that
change
i
think
it
will
come
from
the
private
sector
he
was
quoted
saying
but
i
dont
think
you
want
me
to
determine
whats
good
and
whats
bad
but
i
don‚t
want
to
be
the
biggest‚
he
said
but
i
felt
if
i
made
a
nuisance
of
myself
i
could
help
the
team
but
if
i
could
predict
that
i
would
have
won
the
powerball
last
night
doody
said
but
if
i
hadnt
have
got
into
golf
i
would
have
pursued
a
career
in
motorsport
but
if
less
vehement
the
rallies
sunday
possibly
matched
those
of
two
years
ago
in
scale
but
if
looking
for
company
means
looking
for
those
more
miserable
than
yourself
remember
that
they
will
only
be
there
on
those
bad
days
feeding
you
a
bleakness
that
you
dont
need
but
if
pope
francis
were
a
teacher
in
the
united
states
today
what
would
his
appr
annual
professional
performance
review
rating
be
like
but
if
the
canadian
energy
industry
wants
to
get
a
piece
of
the
future
they
must
gently
push
the
procarbon
dinosaurs
to
the
sidelines
and
celebrate
their
technological
advantage
but
if
the
central
bank
continues
to
raise
rates
without
seeing
higher
inflation
or
an
earnings
pickup
that
could
dent
stocks
but
if
the
stemcell
process
proves
viable
the
foundation
will
consider
helping
commercialize
it
howell
said
but
if
the
video
had
not
reached
the
target
the
spokesman
said
that
in
theory
the
firms
would
have
grounds
to
bring
a
civil
case
for
damages
‚úbut
if
you
don‚t
do
anything
and
a
fire
starts
and
burns
everything
down
then
you‚re
not
blamed‚
but
if
you
recognize
either
them
or
their
vehicle
youre
asked
to
call
the
johnson
county
sheriffs
office
but
if
youre
over
claim
to
be
a
punk
and
havent
heard
of
the
screamers
then
you
dear
should
go
back
to
bellevue
as
we
liked
to
tell
posers
in
the
s
but
if
you
spend
much
time
on
facebook
instagram
or
tinder
youve
seen
this
guy
or
someone
like
him
ahem
justin
bieber
or
james
franco
a
dude
so
enamored
of
his
own
looks
that
most
of
his
photo
posts
are
selfies
but
i
have
a
feeling
theyre
much
like
going
to
a
taylor
swift
concert
but
i
have
to
expect
that
my
papers
would
be
confiscated
in
moscow
immediately
and
that
they
would
harass
my
family
‚úbut
i
knew
i
knew
the
energy
level
‚
the
speaking
the
traveling
the
trying
to
do
other
things
to
help
other
people
‚
i
enjoy
doing
it
but
the
thing
was
i
felt
it
was
time‚
said
ryan
his
eyes
appearing
to
well
up
with
tears
but
i‚ll
be
there
on
thursday
but
i‚m
a
certified
public
accountant
and
a
small
business
owner
and
my
company
serves
over
small
business
clients
too
but
im
always
willing
and
ready
but
i‚m
definitely
not
somebody
that
just
goes
on
after
every
game
and
checks
it
out
but
i
misread
the
signs
she
admits
but
im
not
driving
but
im
really
good
at
looking
at
a
contract
and
finding
things
within
a
contract
that
even
if
theyre
bad
but
im
sure
hes
a
little
amped
up
here
with
his
relatives
coming
down
from
north
carolina
but
in
the
republican
record
will
matter
but
in
all
fairness
we
also
need
to
get
rid
of
the
notion
that
the
police
can
do
no
wrong
that
it
is
aok
for
the
cops
to
beat
the
living
tar
out
of
anyone
they
think
has
dissed
them
but
in
all
of
this
we
were
partners
in
the
building
of
our
country
but
in
an
attempt
to
bolster
his
electability
credentials
in
a
general
election
he
also
pointed
out
that
he
won
a
majority
of
independents
in
his
reelection
bid
last
year
but
in
an
earlier
document
haggen
reported
that
albertsons‚
starting
bid
for
haggen‚s
northeast
fourth
street
street
location
in
renton
was
million
while
its
opening
offer
for
the
first
avenue
south
store
in
burien
was
but
in
an
interview
with
burnley
tv
on
monday
which
dyche
claimed
was
necessary
to
give
a
balanced
view
on
the
games
events
the
burnley
boss
defended
barnes
tackle
but
in
an
interview
with
dw
party
leader
cem
√zdemir
explained
why
not
every
asylum
seeker
can
stay
in
germany
but
in
a
press
conference
lieutenant
john
mccarthy
told
reporters
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
kidnapping
or
a
physical
altercation
but
in
a
sign
of
the
mammoth
challenge
ahead
the
eu
issued
a
stern
warning
to
greece
that
its
place
in
the
eurozone
would
be
at
risk
if
it
failed
to
meet
its
austerity
and
debt
commitments
but
in
a
statement
released
at
the
time
the
video
emerged
the
club
said
it
supported
criminal
action
against
whoever
was
responsible
saying
such
behavior
is
abhorrent
and
has
no
place
in
football
or
society
but
indias
quest
isnt
likely
to
succeed
for
many
reasons
‚
including
the
fact
that
there
are
more
than
types
of
yoga
now
practiced
in
the
west
but
india
versus
pakistan
has
also
been
a
moment
to
bring
the
two
countries
together
but
in
general
it
appears
it
is
very
much
in
line
with
something
weve
been
urging
for
quite
some
time
which
is
greater
involvement
in
the
campaign
to
combat
isil
islamic
state
by
sunni
arab
countries
carter
added
but
in
his
area
kaphle
did
not
see
any
fresh
buildings
down
but
in
jesse
kriel
and
damian
de
allende
the
springboks
have
a
young
and
talented
midfield
combination
but
in
reality
america
would
be
zero
without
our
folks
and
our
families
but
insisting
that
someone
did
not
consent
when
she
asserts
she
did
sounds
a
lot
like
insisting
that
someone
did
consent
when
she
says
she
didnt
but
in
spite
of
the
millions
of
dollars
raised
in
venture
capital
and
scaling
quickly
to
a
huge
audience
traditional
real
estate
brokers
are
still
hanging
in
and
prospering
but
in
the
clowns
must
come
for
reasons
only
clowns
and
composers
know
but
in
the
end
not
even
the
most
advanced
sensor
technology
that
apple
could
obtain
or
design
was
good
enough
to
perform
all
those
sophisticated
healthmonitoring
functions
but
in
the
last
decade
the
wild
thing
hasnt
prospered
in
the
blustery
environs
of
pebble
beach
on
the
monterey
peninsula
in
california
but
in
the
meantime
here‚s
a
closer
look
at
some
of
the
leaked
images
more
in
technology
investing
pandora
still
confident
of
position
as
leader
paypal‚s
dan
schulman
aims
at
millennials‚
wallets
will
the
gogoro
be
the
tesla
of
electric
scooters
but
in
the
new
economy
everyone
should
set
what
i
call
a
failure
ratio
but
in
the
nzz
interview
blatter
explained
he
had
changed
his
mind
as
everybody
is
entitled
to
after
circumstances
changed
a
reference
to
a
number
of
football
associations
asking
him
to
go
on
but
in
this
case
the
opposition
alleges
government
reneged
on
its
commitment
but
in
truth
they
love
saying
i
told
you
so
but
in
what
would
turn
out
to
be
her
pivotal
moment
as
a
soccer
player
the
new
jersey
native
reached
out
to
coach
james
galanis
who
went
on
to
become
her
personal
coach
and
mentor
but
i
point
out
logically
that
this
all
started
with
an
article
in
that
turned
out
to
be
completely
inaccurate
and
was
retracted
twelve
years
later
he
said
but
islamic
scholars
accused
the
group
of
violating
religious
law
and
cherrypicking
from
religious
verses
to
justify
their
brutality
but
is
will
be
acutely
aware
of
this
very
public
debate
and
will
very
likely
look
to
punish
britain
in
the
way
it
has
already
targeted
france
but
it
all
changed
in
game
two
of
the
season
when
tucker
was
pressed
into
the
role
of
quarterback
following
an
injury
by
starter
brett
burnett
but
it
also
calls
for
something
quite
novel
which
the
government
should
have
done
the
moment
it
dug
out
of
the
financial
crisis
what
they
term
‚úsimplifying
the
institutional
structure‚
but
it
also
gives
the
public
a
false
impression
they
dont
get
a
sense
of
the
conveyor
belt
fashion
in
which
the
vast
majority
of
criminal
trials
are
conducted
but
it
also
has
subscribers
to
a
weekly
email
blast
facebook
followers
nearly
twitter
followers
and
more
than
instagram
followers
but
it
also
responds
to
scalias
speculative
comment
that
its
not
a
good
thing
for
the
university
of
texas
to
admit
as
many
blacks
possible
which
misrepresents
the
schools
position
but
it
became
such
a
part
of
peoples
routines
that
it
could
not
be
removed
but
it
came
at
great
political
cost
but
it
comes
at
a
price
but
it
estimates
that
the
change
wont
save
the
program
any
money
for
the
first
years
but
would
result
in
some
cost
reductions
after
but
it
felt
different
i
was
running
for
pride
but
i
think
if
we
continue
to
play
with
effort
energy
we
played
with
and
great
communication
really
get
dialed
into
the
calls
that
we
have
over
and
over
i
think
this
can
be
a
good
defense
but
i
think
it
can
good
for
oregon
if
they
grow
from
this
but
i
think
that
amos
yee
is
not
doing
himself
or
his
family
any
favors
she
said
but
i
think
the
officer
is
going
to
get
off
but
i
think
what
they
want
to
see
immediately
are
the
indicators
of
a
new
way
of
doing
business
but
it
is
also
as
some
doctors
say
a
form
of
muscular
meditation
but
it
is
also
out
to
offer
value
but
it
is
an
exception
but
it
is
a
relief
he
added
and
one
step
closer
to
closure
but
it
is
true
that
many
influential
seemingly
authoritative
players
from
alan
greenspan
on
down
insisted
not
only
that
there
was
no
bubble
but
that
no
bubble
was
even
possible
but
it
is
unclear
how
much
of
north
korea‚s
limited
financial
resources
have
been
put
into
improving
the
lot
of
the
majority
of
its
citizens
who
are
not
fortunate
enough
to
live
in
the
showcase
capital
but
it
may
have
been
stone
of
lajes
air
base
azores
who
took
the
biggest
risk
but
it
must
not
come
at
the
expense
of
our
integrity
our
relationships
with
europe
and
our
own
interests
but
it
never
made
it
to
broadway
until
now
but
it
nonetheless
will
amount
to
an
international
recognition
‚
in
an
expected
vote
by
the
united
nations
security
council
‚
that
iran
has
the
right
to
produce
nuclear
materials
that
have
aroused
security
concerns
but
it
once
came
much
closer
continue
reading
the
main
story
an
alien
star
passed
through
our
solar
system
just
years
ago
astronomers
have
discovered
but
it
provided
one
last
opportunity
for
the
parties
to
show
indigenous
peoples
that
they
are
committed
to
a
relationship
built
on
foundations
of
respect
justice
and
recognition
but
it
quickly
becomes
evident
that
he
has
a
formidable
adversary
in
the
bolshoi‚s
new
general
director
vladimir
urin
who
has
been
brought
in
to
clean
up
the
mess
but
it
remains
heavily
dependent
‚
critics
say
too
much
so
‚
on
the
coyotes
for
traffic
but
it
requires
extraordinary
effort
to
sustain
such
rapid
growth
and
transformation
but
its
actually
a
nebula
with
a
giant
star
at
its
center
but
its
also
more
than
just
some
usb
stick
that
you
carry
your
office
documents
around
on
this
things
a
genuine
pc
assuming
youve
got
a
keyboard
and
mouse
to
go
along
with
everything
but
its
also
often
a
way
to
deny
workers
fair
pay
and
equitable
treatment
but
its
an
education
that
alshabaab
is
trying
to
prevent
the
children
from
obtaining
according
to
ndonye
but
its
a
way
to
lend
a
hand
to
his
family
organizer
romain
jumelet
told
french
television
but
its
been
that
way
from
the
start
but
its
far
from
over
but
its
hard
on
the
players
but
it
should
be
noted
that
one
of
the
shareholders
suing
the
government
over
fannie
and
freddie
hedge
fund
manager
bill
ackman
has
brought
his
case
in
federal
claims
court
in
washington‚the
same
court
hearing
the
greenberg
case
but
it‚s
noteworthy
just
because
so
many
investors
didn‚t
even
bother
to
look
at
the
balance
sheet
‚
and
in
fact
box
priced
above
its
initial
ipo
range
despite
the
obvious
risks
then
popped
on
its
first
day
of
trading
but
its
still
kind
of
a
big
deal
but
its
the
characters
from
de
niros
jimmy
conway
to
the
illfated
billy
batts
who
fans
just
cant
seem
to
let
go
of
but
its
the
halo
halo
fries
that
really
caught
our
attention
as
theyll
come
topped
with
sauteed
pork
japanese
kewpie
mayo
and
bonito
flakes
but
it‚s
the
potential
hazards
to
life
and
limb
that
really
concern
him
but
its
time
to
spread
my
wings
and
look
forward
to
better
things
but
its
too
late
to
save
the
store
but
its
wrong
to
assume
that
a
few
hundred
more
american
troops
will
solve
the
internal
friction
between
the
shiites
sunnis
and
kurds
long
added
but
it
turns
out
that
theres
an
unspoken
mutual
consent
underlying
that
enterprise
but
it
was
his
head‚s
up
baserunning
that
tied
the
game
at
but
it
was
korczaks
bitter
end
that
created
his
lasting
legacy
but
it
was
replaced
when
the
inspector
arrived
to
do
a
followup
inspection
on
dec
ichiben
corrected
the
violations
and
has
a
green
placard
posted
at
its
entrance
but
it
was
the
freshmade
tagliatelle
in
a
spicy
tomato
sauce
with
clams
shrimp
octopus
and
eggplant
that
commanded
seconds
and
thirds
‚úbut
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
happens
now
between
her
and
reece‚
but
it
will
have
helped
mr
kuroda
that
japan
is
no
longer
the
only
developed
country
locked
in
a
tryst
with
mild
deflation
oilprice
falls
have
affected
several
economies
but
it
worked
out
in
the
end
but
ive
got
a
lot
of
bills
to
pay
but
jay
davis
who
plays
gabriel
became
ill
and
lost
his
voice
just
before
the
first
preview
show
but
jeff
bezoss
original
vision
the
everything
store
as
it
was
described
in
a
history
of
the
firm
has
been
realised
in
spades
but
jindals
recentlyreleased
tax
plan
might
just
take
the
cake
but
john
lennon
who
wrote
the
lyrics
always
maintained
that
it
was
inspired
by
a
picture
drawn
by
his
fiveyearold
son
but
jordan
was
optimistic
on
the
overall
outcome
of
the
event
but
just
hours
after
setting
up
her
first
facebook
page
on
sunday
hillary
clinton
had
stormed
to
likes
and
more
than
million
video
views
but
just
as
a
movie
a
video
game
or
a
good
book
can
be
fascinating
without
any
pretense
about
being
real
pepper
is
fun
but
just
as
much
as
darnell
nurse
and
leon
draisaitl
theres
excitement
there
that
future
nhlers
are
in
the
lineup
but
just
as
some
were
calling
for
his
head
and
seemingly
from
nowhere
the
team
has
produced
two
jawdropping
performances
without
several
bigname
players
to
back
up
marchs
win
over
bitter
rival
mexico
but
just
because
it‚s
the
city
that
never
sleeps
don‚t
expect
it
to
be
open
on
sundays
but
just
because
were
involved
and
we
have
a
strategy
doesnt
mean
were
going
to
be
able
to
dictate
the
outcome
but
ken
richards
a
former
member
of
the
higher
education
funding
council
for
wales
backed
the
universitys
london
move
but
klacansky
says
thats
not
what
happened
but
ladue
doesn‚t
seem
to
have
any
real
grievances
but
la
familia
fled
to
the
neighboring
states
of
guerrero
and
mexico
where
it
now
fights
other
regional
gangs
for
control
of
the
lucrative
and
growing
heroin
trade
but
last
fridays
presidential
‚úno‚
to
the
mile
km
pipeline
out
of
albertas
oil

may
signal
more
than
just
a
single
if
remarkable
win
for
environmentalists
but
lately
the

has
been
destroying
more
wealth
than
creating
it
but
lately
there
have
been
portents
that
the
old
queen
is
reviving
and
so
who‚re
you
going
to
call
but
later
this
year
the
british
government
plans
to
introduce
draft
legislation
dealing
with
encryption
in
the
hopes
of
stopping
the
next
teenage
terrorist
but
lawmakers
must
still
pass
detailed
spending
bills
parceling
the
funding
to
different
portions
of
the
government
butler

in

series
as

wouldnt
bag

as

but
lest
that
seem
an
overly
harsh
indictment
of
the
united
states
moore
also
seeks
to
remind
us
that
many
of
these
admirable
ideas
originated
in
america
in
the
first
place
but
lets
assume
the
figure
is
accurate
but
liberty
island
did
not
seem
to
be
rising
very
quickly
but
like
any
tech
productivity
tool
it
has
an
associated
learning
curve
basic
usage
hours
intermediate
hours
and
jedi
proficiency
hours
but
like
i
said
the
culture
that
theyve
created
now
the
guys
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
it
theyre
taking
pride
in
our
country
and
i
just
think
its
fantastic
but
liu
yiqian
has
stunned
the
art
world
by
setting
a
new
benchmark
in
the
incredible
buying
power
of
wealthy
chinese
investors
with
his
us
million
purchase
of
amedeo
modigliani‚s
reclining
nude
but
local
thai
media
reports
have
said
the
suspect
flew
on
to
turkey
rather
than
china
but
looking
beyond
those
attentiongetting
and
avidly
photographed
chiseled
torsos
one
could
find
references
in
the
prints
to
new
yorks
chrysler
building
to
new
york
waterway
maps
and
also
to
gargoyles
from
the
tops
of
buildings
but
louisianamonroe
could
do
nothing
on
offense
in
the
opening
minutes
but
mani
challenged
the
attempted
suicide
charge
citing
the
countrys
history
of
hunger
strikes
but
manipulation
and
murder
are
two
different
things
but
many
new
york
subway
riders
will
not
likely
soon
get
over
the
irony
but
many
they
said
they
were
thankful
to
see
another
christmas
but
mario
has
a
few
tricks
up
his
sleeves
and
you
can
see
what
the
mustachioed
plumber
has
in

for

by
watching
the

below
but
marks
says
coleman

committed

but

popularity
is
worldwide
with

followers
on

but
matthews
says
drilling
on
an
island
is
safer
than
drilling
offshore
but
maybe
it
doesnt
matter
the
reboot
is
trying
to
become
a
story
of
fame
and
identity
in
the
internet
age
and
the
series
broader
conceits
might
just
help
it
get
there
but
mayor
john
tory
warned
that
if
the
company
cant
deliver
it
may
not
be
doing
business
with
the

in
the

but
mcilroy
didnt
flinch
when
rodgers
drained
a
foot
putt
on

to
pull
within
three
shots
of

but
meadows
says
one
idea
he
and
others
have
discussed
is
to
specify
that
that
resolution
not
be
subject
to
a
filibuster
in
the
senate
but
midazolams
anesthetic
properties
are
facts
of
a
different
sort
because
they
transcend
the
particular
legal
dispute
and
could
recur
in
other
cases
with
different
parties
and
issues

recent

more

most
importantly
look
beyond
pure
financial
issues
but
most

around

most
of
the

with

tend
to
follow
more
sinful

lines
that
are

often
criticized
as
inappropriate
but
mr
lightman
general
secretary
of
the

head
teachers

said
the
proposals
were
muddled
but
mr
nkurunzizas
supporters
argue
that
he
is
entitled
to
another
term
because
he
was
first
elected
by
parliament
in
not

mr
schumer
said
that
after
deep
study
careful
thought
and
considerable
soulsearching
he
had
decided
to
oppose
the

when
the
senate
votes
on
it
in

after

the

the

neither

no

side
of

is
rising
as
high
as
donald

who
surges
to

no
hard
numbers
or
even

were
apparent
among
xinhuas
reporting
on
how
beijing
will
deal
with
the
countrys
economic

but
none
has
demonstrated
that
its
exploitability
‚
the
ability
of
a
perfect
human
player
to
beat
the
machine
‚
is
as
small
as
the

designed
by

team
but
none
of
the

abducted
from
a

in
chibok

were
among
them
but
nope
thats
not
usually
how
it
works
people
but
not
all
beer

are
devoid
of
meaning
but
not
all
food
parcels
are
the

but
not
all
topics
were
on
the
table
for
discussion
but
not
everyone
makes
that
transition
but
not
everything
in
the
drugstore
giant‚s
aisles
is
healthy
for
your
wallet
but
not
having

would
be
costly
as

nothing
beats
official

so
far
apple
is
being
unusually
tightlipped
when
it
comes

not
with

now
years
later
in
her
modest
new
orleans
midcity

she
explains
why
she
believes
the
death
penalty
revictimizes
people
but
now
actually
the
situation
has
changed
so
that
we
get
a
remittance
and
after
two
or
three
weeks
we
get
paid
but
now
as

now
it‚s
a

iovine

but
now
its
gone
the
original

at

but
now
mall
management
is
having
a
change
of
heart
after
receiving
some
hearty
customer
feedback
usa
today
reported
but
now
scientists
led
by
edward
archer
an
obesity
researcher
at
the
nutrition
obesity
research
center
at
the
university
alabama
at
birmingham
are
asking
which
is
worse
inaccurate
data
or
no
data
at
all
but
now
the
china
securities
regulatory
commission
has
started
letting
mutual

invest
through
the
stock
connect
boosting
trading
volume
but
now
we
dont
call
them
because
they
hurt
us
but
now
we
have
technologies
like
flash
coming
along
and
customers
can
see
new
opportunities
and
the
chance
to
use
storage
to
take
advantage
but
obama
cant
hold
a
candle
to
bush
when
it
comes
to
selfmockery
but
obama
repeatedly
does
so
after
shootings
saying
britain
and
australia
for
instance
had
passed
gun
control
laws
to
prevent
new
massacres
but
obamas
visit
is
also
geared
toward
displaying
solidarity
with
alaska
natives
who
face
immense
economic
challenges
and
have
warned
of
insufficient
help
from
the
federal
government
but
officials
heading
water
agencies
in
the
two
states
and
california
took
a
waitandsee
approach
to
the
projections
posted
by
the
us
bureau
of
reclamation
but
officials
say
recent
water
samples
show
no
health
risks
for
athletes
but
olmstead
says
she
would
have
liked
to
know
what
the
outcome
would
have
been
but
once
we
do
well
be
working
hand
and
glove
with
them
to
make
sure
that
the
work
that
weve
been
doing
for
the
past
couple
of
years
is
helpful
to
their
eventual
campaign
but
once
youre
within
five
to
years
of
actually
pulling
the
trigger
on
retirement
you
want
to
get
a
more
accurate
sense
of
how
much
youre
likely
to
spend
after
the
paychecks
stop
but
one
expert
told
the
bbc
the
number
of
victims
was
much
higher
as
ticket
fraud
is
massively
underreported
but
one
official
told
the
afp
news
agency
their
activities
were
being
monitored
since
a
long
time
but
one
of
the
dogs
followed
him
home
snapping
at
his
legs
and
trying
to
bite
the
surviving
poodle
but
one
of
the
goals
targets
is
to
halve
the
number
of
people
living
in
poverty
according
to
national
definitions
by

on
his
return
to
vienna
faymann
warned
that
the

would
not
be
ready
in
time
but
on
tuesday
social
media
rallied
around
the
actor
after
he
revealed
that
he
is
hivpositive
but
on
tuesday
the
shares
fell
as
much
as
at
one
point
before
staging
a
huge
comeback
in
the
last
half
hour
of

to
finish
the
day
up

orbital

been

an
extended
break
from

th

a
fiery
nighttime
display
just
seconds
after

other

support
the
idea
of
the

saving
money
wherever
it
can
even
in
the
fire
department
but
others
dont
get
their
children
back
but
others
note
the
paradoxes
environmental
degradation
alongside
unspoiled
areas
a
history
of
poor
education
that
for
decades
didnt
preclude
highpaying
jobs
an
awayfromitall
feel
partly
caused
by
a
lack
of
good
roads
and
other
infrastructure
but
other
terrorist
leaders
have
followed
in
his
wake
‚úbut
our
plan
is
just
to
go

that‚s
what
we‚re

over

the
deterioration

may
be
wearying

most
egregious

browns
placement
in

over
the

but
pete
carroll
has
thrived
in
a
traditionally
autocratic

through
a
positive
coaching
style
but
petersen
keeps
referring
to
his
quarterback
‚úplan‚
which
to
those
parsing
his
words
indicates
that
he
might
use
more
than
one

a
notion
he
certainly
didn‚t
discourage
but
police

can
get
beaten
up
pretty
badly
and
its
far
from

the

can
stand
up
to
patrol

on
a
daytoday
basis
but
policymakers
seem
not
to
have
taken
a
single
step
closer
to
a
solution
but
prati
expects
shoppers
are
likely
to
use
instore
pickup
and
online
fulfillment
options
as
an
alternative
to
facing
crowds
at
a

in

with
caution

said
they
would
veto

putin
didnt
intercede
in
syria
to
help
barack
obama
but
putting
together

clearly
involves
more
skill

raffi
cavoukian
the

spending
his

rather
than

for

the

a

roses
mother
a

for

wanted
their

there
but
russia
denounced
the
outcome
of
the
un

as
a
strategic
error
but
ruzow
said
the
hopi
relocation
has
been
problematic
since
the
beginning
because
of
the
site
chosen
by
the
relocated

but
ryan
rwis
also
told

was
willing

work
with

to
see
if

can
find

said
tourists
were
dressed

says
monitoring

much
more

the
introduction

scoring
remains
an
issue
‚
the
rams

in

security
threats
continued
to
grow
around
the

forces
were
now
also
engaged
in
a
longterm
fight
against
islamic

in
iraq
and
syria
he
said
but
senate
democratic
leader
harry
reid
cautioned
that
disagreement
continued
over
the
energy
provisions
but
seven
seasons
in
lcm
is
still
trying
to
find
a
balance
between
commerciality
and
creativity
but
shadow
foreign
secretary
hilary
benn
told
the
same
programme
it
was
the
conservatives
that
were
being
ideological
and
the
recently
reprivatised
east
coast
line
had
shown
that
publiclyowned
rail
could
work
but
she
added
that
progress
has
stalled
and
that
the
labor
force
participation
of
us
women
has
dropped
from
seventh
out
of
advanced
nations
to
th
but
she
did
admit
that
shes
a
bit
more
reserved
than
some
other
politicians
out
there
but
she
has
an
immediate
challenge
ahead
of
her
getting
her
university
degree
but
she
has
found
partners
across
the
aisle
including
barbara
boxer
one
of
california‚s
two
democratic
senators
but
she
has
reservations
about
where
the
story
of
the
bellas
could
go
but
she
is
confident
spain
will
not
be
directly
affected
as
long
as
the
right
party
is
in
power
but
she
is
trying
but
sheriff
joe
arpaios
stubborn
streak
is
catching
up
with
him
‚
and
taxpayers
will
foot
the
bill
but
she
says
the
public
reaction
to
hunts
remarks
highlights
their
rarity
but
she
urges
people
to
stop
assuming
that
all
veiled
women
are
oppressed
but
she
was
also
smart
and
funny
and
could
play
a
mean
mouth
bow
but
she
wont
be
parted
from
the
jewel
for
long
an
honest
fireman
who
found
it
is
returning
it
to
her
‚úbut
she
won‚t
need
to
worry
about
if
the
book
is
going
to
sell
or
not
she
can
just
write
for
the
enjoyment‚
but
shockingly
our
elected
officials
do
not
appear
to
be
on
the
same
page
but
similar
thinking
is
happening
elsewhere
but
simmons
has
shown
that
he
still
has
the
skippers
touch
while
morris
has
settled
in
nicely
at
third
but
since
appearing
in
the
london
paralympics
opening
ceremony
and
going
on
to
star
in
a
number
of
advertisements
he
says
he
has
overcome
the
lack
of
confidence
he
suffered
as
a
child
and
believes
fashion
can
do
the
same
for
others
but
since
it
was
a
cop
just
maybe
they
decided
to
give
some
attitude
for
excitement
in
public
but
since
that
time
unfortunately
it
doesnt
seem
like
much
has
really
changed
but
since
the
ingredient
is
not
fundamentally
changing
the
form
he
said
the
ingredients
are
still
within
fda
guidelines
of
permissible
color
sources
but
since
then
apple
has
rolled
out
a
new
photos
app
with
much
cheaper
storage
and
google
and
flickr
have
jumped
in
with
more
generous
and
fullfeatured
photo
services
of
their
own
but
since
the
nominations
were
announced
birdman
has
been
coming
on
strong
winning
a
number
of
guild
awards
but
since
then
the
partys
popularity
has
surged
not
diminished
and
sturgeon
argues
that
support
clearly
shows
scots
want
a
sea
change
in
british
politics
that
listens
to
their
aspirations
but
so
far
little
has
happened
and
there
are
no
new
initiatives
to
reunite
the
people
of
the
diomede
islands
with
their
relatives
in
russia
but
so
far
there
have
been
no
reports
of
is
damage
to
the
ruins
or
antiquities
in
palmyra
which
is
known
locally
as
tadmur
but
some
are
unhappy
with
the
way
they
are
being
treated
during
their
final
days
with
the
company
but
some
critics
say
the
government
is
using
a
sledgehammer
to
crack
a
nut
but
some
defense
officials
have
said
they
have
broad
concerns
about
the
impact
of
such
a
change
but
some
of
his
rhetoric
about
islam
on
the
campaign
trail
‚
including
his
call
to
monitor
mosques
and
his
proposal
this
week
to
temporarily
bar
muslims
from
entering
the
us
‚
has
led
to
increased
wariness
in
the
arab
world
but
some
of
the
money
trump‚s
campaign
spends
is
used
to
reimburse
him
his
largest
expense
in
the
last
filing
period
was
on
a
company
he
owns
tag
air
which
controls
the
fleet
of
aircraft
he
uses
to
fly
to
all
his
events
but
someone
in
the
store
had
doused
the
flames
with
a
fire
extinguisher
before
firefighters
arrived
and
the
fire
was
small
enough
that
it
did
not
trigger
any
sprinklers
fire
officials
said
but
some
people
wouldnt
mind
risking
the
occasional
delay
if
it
meant
getting
the
best
possible
listening
experience
and
this
is
something
that
most
every
other
streaming
service
already
offers
but
something
seemed
out
of
whack
but
some
viewers
who
loyally
followed
the
show
feel
so
betrayed
by
the
latest
plot
turn
they
say
theyll
never
watch
again
but
somewhere
along
the
line
it
all
fell
apart
but
soon
many
countries‚led
by
china
and
the
us‚elbowed
in
making
deals
with
the
fractured
political
infrastructure
to
gain
access
to
the
country‚s
oil
but
spies
rejner
wants
to
go
a
step
further
the
travel
agency
even
provided
six
exercise
videos
to
invigorate
men
and
womens
sex
drives
but
starting
wednesday
a
day
after
a
jury
was
selected
the
focus
will
shift
dramatically
from
the
legal
process
to
the
harsh
reality
of
what
happened
that
day
the
explosions
the
screams
the
chaos
and
the
blood
but
still
its
clear
that
we
are
increasingly
comfortable
watching
video
in
our
hand
but
stoffels
quick
actions
werent
enough
to
save
her
daughter
olivia
and
her
husband
johnathon
adam
bentdahl
an
unrelated
appleton
man
also
died
but
strip
away
the
rhetoric
and
republicans
and
democrats
are
not
as
far
apart
on
fighting
is
as
it
may
appear
say
some
observers
and
lawmakers
in
congress
but
such
complacency
is
misplaced
but
suddenly
portugal
is
a
little
bit
kinder
place
than
it
was
a
month
ago
but
superior
court
judge
stephen
a
marcus
said
he
could
not
evaluate
the
credibility
of
witnesses
at
a
preliminary
hearing
but
taking
them
away
from
a
series
that
always
had
them
is
a
decision
i
dont
think
will
sit
well
with
a
lot
of
people
but
taller
towers
and
bigger
turbines
are
unlocking
new
potential
in
the
south
according
to
the
us
department
of
energy
and
the
industry
is
already
looking
to
invest
butt
believes
the
law
strikes
the
right
balance
between
freedom
of
expression
and
protecting
groups
from
hatred
but
telling
the
same
story
onscreen
was
a
challenge
partially
because
the
young
actor
was
not
told
the
more
distressing
parts
of
the
screenplay
but
tensions
were
renewed
after
the
death
of
a
black
man
in
baltimore
who
suffered
a
spinal
cord
injury
in
police
custody
but
thanks
to
a
billion
cut
in
its
fuel
bill
american
reported
friday
that
it
earned
a
record
million
but
that
can
all
change
in
a
round
in
which
she
and
her
costar
have
to
name
the
play
that
inspired
these
celebrated
bigscreen
adaptations
but
that
cost
which
is
a
few
hundred
dollars
far
outweighs
the
fines
and
repair
bills
but
that
didnt
stop
carmen
and
shannon
wamplercollins
from
successfully
walking
out
of
the
rowan
county
kentucky
clerks
office
with
a
marriage
license
in
hand
but
that
didnt
stop
us
from
beating
them
but
that
difference
disappeared
when
the
researchers
considered
weight
race
education
health
insurance
and
other
factors
that
can
influence
frequency
of
medical
visits
but
that
doesnt
mean
it
shows
where
el
chapo
is
or
reveals
when
the
picture
was
taken
but
that
doesnt
seem
likely
but
that
gender
gap
is
closing
according
to
recently
published
research
from
the
center
for
retirement
research
at
boston
college
but
that
is
a
story
for
another
day
for
the
queen
this
recordbreaking
achievement
is
merely
a
milestone
not
the
end
she
continues
to
carry
out
a
full
and
unrelenting
royal
schedule
but
that
isnt
happening
entz
said
but
that
is
something
very
different
than
a
troika
that
is
beholden
to
nobody
but
that
kid
came
out
the
little
royal
kid
came
out
and
they
went
through
the
opening
which
was
like
cloth
and
he
went
outside
and
there
mustve
been
people
and
it
was
just
air
but
that
matter
still
has
mass
and
therefore
gravitational
effects
pope
added
but
that
may
be
enough
to
preserve
their
narrow
majority
in
congress
partly
due
to
divisions
among
rival
parties
but
that
message
doesnt
seem
to
be
getting
through
but
that
occurred
for
a
good
reason
hundreds
of
thousands
more
people
sought
jobs
in
may
and
not
all
found
them
but
that
person
is
very
much
on
the
minds
of
her
family
and
friends
who
are
anxious
for
the
murderer
to
be
captured
or
turn
him
or
herself
in
i
dont
understand
why
you
took
her
life
said
jessica
sayre
but
that
product
went
through
the
hands
of
many
firms
before
it
got
to
us
but
that
remains
to
be
seen
but
thats
a
function
of
how
much
we
know
about
genes
and
disease
but
thats
not
for
lack
of
trying
lombardi
said
but
thats
not
their
goal
immediately
but
thats
the
way
i
feel
in
my
body
but
thats
what
our
governments
were
trying
to
do
but
that
was
eventually
revised
to
just
a
decline
and
was
followed
by
a
brisk
pace
in
the
second
quarter
but
the
gangrape
case
hastened
the
legal
changes
but
the
piece
guitar
juggernaut
from
nashville
had
built
up
their
chicago
fanbase
with
multiple
trips
through
town
on
their
last
tour
and
the
group
did
their
best
to
melt
the
frost
with
the
heat
of
their
overdriven
amps
but
the
agency
beyonc√
took
in
displaying
flaunting
concealing
and
using
her
body
onstage
and
onscreen
differentiated
her
from
other
female
performers
who
have
seemingly
been
positioned
as
scantilyclad
puppets
selling
itunes
singles
but
the
appeals
court
said
the
faa
has
always
had
discretion
on
how
to
handle
issues
such
as
portable
electronics
and
was
free
to
change
its
interpretation
of
the
rules
but
the
art
of
mixology
is
flourishing
here
in
the
city
that
never
chugs
and
those
who
remain
steadfast
on
the
path
to
a
beer
gut
are
missing
out
but
the
biggest
advantage
that
the
active
has
over
the
regular
handset
is
that
it
is
shock
dust
and
waterresistant
but
the
big
winner
was
cuba
gooding
jr
whose
performance
as
rod
show
me
the
money
tidwell
earned
him
the
best
supporting
actor
oscar
but
the
biles
didnt
share
their
backstory
until
years
later
but
the
boy‚s
family
stopped
macintosh
and
took
the
abuse
to
police
but
the
case
is
similar
to
a
court
battle
won
by
survivors
of
st
annes
but
the
challengers
in
this
case
argue
that
texas
must
primarily
look
at
the
total
number
of
eligible
voters
in
the
state
but
the
companies
are
also
subject
to
accounting
quirks
that
can
make
earnings
volatile
but
the
company
never
provided
specifics
but
the
concerns
raised
by
school
districts
may
not
be
too
farfetched
but
the
continued
glut
is
starting
to
discourage
that
strategy
but
the
converse
side
of
that
is
i
dont
really
want
to
see
dudes
kissing
but
the
danger
with
this
sort
of
thing
is
to
let
it
go
on
forever
but
the
deaths
of
rahman
of
roy
of
haider
have
emboldened
the
movement
rather
than
chill
them
into
silence
but
the
defence
countered
that
cormier
had
a
right
to
defend
himself
on
his
own
property
when
eldridge
showed
up
with
a
metal
pipe
but
the
detroit
facemask
penalty
extended
the
game
and
the
packers
pulled
off
the
miracle
but
the
diversionary
maneuver
if
indeed
thats
what
it
was
ultimately
had
consequences
that
not
even
maassen
himself
had
considered
but
the
driving
threechord
instrumental
progression
was
maddeningly
memorable
as
were
the
songs
opening
lines
delivered
with
just
the
right
amount
of
rebellious
if
slurry
snarl
but
the
embassy
of
saudi
arabia
in
washington
said
in
a
statement
wednesday
that
zacarias
moussaouis
claims
come
from
a
deranged
criminal
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
them
but
the
enqu√™te
investigation
shows
the
situation
varies
from
region
to
region
and
the
quality
of
service
is
inconsistent
but
the
established
nature
of
concrete
and
steel
means
that
clt
will
not
replace
urban
building
materials
overnight
but
the
expectation
is
the
irs
wont
see
a
big
bump
up
in
funding
if
any
at
all
but
the
expo
is
here
and
it
will
be
very
beautiful
he
added
but
the
falcon
s
work
will
not
end
after
sending
dragon
on
its
way
but
the
familiarity
i
find
is
the
one
i
find
to
be
sad
but
the
fantasy
becomes
a
nightmare
when
they
discover
the
dead
body
of
an
unknown
woman
in
the
loft
and
they
realize
one
of
the
group
must
be
involved
but
the
fate
of
migrants
was
still
uncertain
after
talks
in
brussels
on
monday
but
the
fence
is
behind
schedule
but
the
flavors
are
intense
and
unusual
but
the
floodgates
wouldnt
remain
closed
for
long
but
the
folks
at
twitter
had
better
start
thinking
hard
about
what
that
means
and
how
they
are
planning
to
get
there
but
the
freefall
was
more
than
enough
to
get
investors
attention
but
the
g
never
actually
said
that
renewables
will
be
the
energy
source
of
the
future
but
the
generator
has
since
been
repaired
and
is
back
in
operation
but
the
governor
and
state
legislature
without
another
moment‚s
delay
must
also
take
action
on
the
age
at
which
children
can
be
placed
in
adult
jails
as
the
governors
commission
on
youth
public
safety
and
justice
recommended
but
the
greatest
of
these
is
love
but
the
greek
minister
disputes
the
interpretation
but
the
greens
have
promised
tough
negotiations
if
approached
to
form
a
coalition
and
warned
that
the
spd
should
not
expect
to
deal
with
pushovers
but
the
group
said
it
hopes
the
universitys
decision
will
inspire
further
ecologically
focused
sentiment
and
legislation
but
the
guidelines
dont
recommend
that
the
students
copy
a
particular
teaching
or
verse
stoll
said
but
the
guitarists
daughters
alleged
that
kings
personal
assistant
myron
johnson
and
toney
gave
him
medication
to
induce
diabetic
shock
but
the
iguanas
that
recently
arrived
at
shedd
tell
another
story
of
how
research
can
unexpectedly
benefit
wildlife
conservation
but
the
implant
offers
a
way
to
attack
cancers
that
are
deeper
in
the
body
and
thus
less
accessible
to
injections
but
the
incident
has
also
led
to
a
newly
found
freedom
but
the
influx
of
money
would
help
reddit‚s
overwhelmed
managers
keep
up
with
the
site‚s
growth
but
the
injury
didnt
completely
ground
her
but
the
interior
affairs
spokesman
in
merkels
own
christian
democratic
cdu
party
wolfgang
bosbach
said
the
csus
demand
was
not
a
majority
view
among
conservatives
but
the
involvement
of
ministers
and
senior
officials
from
outside
the
department
of
health
raises
many
questions
about
this
style
of
administration
but
their
ability
to
overcome
the
mistakes
against
a
team
loaded
with
playmakers
bodes
well
for
a
stretch
drive
despite
the
devastating
news
that
tight
end
jimmy
graham
has
been
lost
for
the
season
but
their
opponents
insist
the
campaign
to
retake
anbar
is
on
track
but
the
islamist
insurgents
have
since
lost
most
of
their
gains
to
military
counteroffensives
but
the
kiev
military
said
rebel
attacks
were
continuing
to
test
the
ceasefire
across
a
wide
area
of
the
east
including
near
mariupol
on
the
sea
of
azov
one
of
the
last
big
towns
still
held
by
the
government
but
the
kings
students
union
says
it
has
no
faith
the
school
will
refrain
from
raising
fees
if
that
option
is
available
but
the
law
requires
that
an
exercise
be
conducted
to
secure
the
signatures
of
seven
per
cent
of
the
electorate
in
the
municipality
he
explained
but
the
liberal
islamic
association
welcomed
√zdemir
and
becks
intervention
but
the
longserving
prime
minister
stayed
in
the
job
as
long
as
he
kept
the
support
of
members
in
the
third
place
progressive
party
but
the
madness
that
will
plague
him
until
his
death
is
already
evident
and
villagers
begin
to
distance
themselves
as
he
stops
eating
and
bathing
but
the
michigan
appeals
court
reversed
that
decision
last
year
but
the
montana
tax
appeal
board
said
in
a
series
of
rulings
in
recent
months
that
blixseth
had
failed
to
make
his
case
but
then
again
as
said
i
already
had
smoke
in
my
lungs
but
then
beyonc√
appeared
on
my
television
screen
and
spent
the
next
several
minutes
extolling
the
benefits
of
a
vegan
diet
but
the
ndp
clearly
has
the
wind
at
its
back
but
the
new
jersey
native
wasnt
front
of
mind
especially
after
her
soso
performance
in
us
opener
against
australia
but
the
news
industry
has
been
flipped
on
its
head
since
then
thanks
to
the
internet
and
smart
phones
but
then
his
beard
appeared
and
his
career
as
a
serious
actor
took
off
but
then
on
jan
the
montreal
police
confirmed
paul
had
been
assigned
to
lesser
duties
while
he
was
being
investigated
reportedly
by
the
rcmp
and
another
government
agency
but
then
people
began
entering
his
car
from
the
front
of
the
train
reporting
gas
smells
but
then
there‚s
that
weird
pseudoeasterneuropean
accent
which
makes
every
utterance
seem
strange
and
new
like
you
never
quite
know
where
it‚s
going
but
then
things
escalated
and
he
and
friends
found
themselves
going
out
to
restaurants
in
white
coats
posing
as
record
producers
‚
and
to
jets
games
but
then
uncle
sam
would
get
less
income
from
the
tariffs
but
then
you
have
to
take
a
chance
to
survive
muthoni
said
but
the
opposition
which
recently
lost
power
and
law
experts
say
kaczynskis
moves
are
unconstitutional
and
undemocratic
but
the
panel
noted
that
previous
assessments
from
those
in
the
military
or
the
va
minimized
the
health
risk
of
exposure
often
saying
any
agent
orange
residues
on
the
interior
surfaces
could
not
have
moved
from
their
location
and
endangered
humans
but
the
performance
also
marked
the
moment
where
the
seams
on
biebers
year
of
public
penitence
began
to
show
and
it
found
him
crossing
the
thin
line
separating
genuine
apology
and
robotic
unfeeling
appeasement
but
the
phrase
dum
spiro
spero
is
why
i
am
encouraged
about
south
carolinas
future
it
means
while
i
breathe
i
hope
but
the
police
seem
to
know
very
well
who
they
are
but
the
potential
damage
is
worse
but
the
president
has
also
asked
for
patience
in
tackling
the
problem
saying
indonesia
needs
three
years
to
solve
it
but
the
quality
of
education
deteriorated
severely
during
five
decades
of
military
rule
but
the
question
isnt
just
whether
someone
appears
in
one
of
these
databases
but
also
how
current
the
information
is
but
the
railroad
iron
remains
essentially
glued
together
by
mud
and
silt
from
the
riverbed
but
there
are
dozens
of
provisions
in
the
new
legislation
so
taxpayers
need
to
get
their
records
in
order
so
they
can
claim
what
applies
to
them
but
there
are
signs
the
downturn
could
be
nearing
its
end
as
the
dollar
rally
fades
the
supply
chain
normalizes
after
being
disrupted
by
a
labor
dispute
at
west
coast
ports
and
business
spending
outside
the
energy
sector
picks
up
but
the
recent
urban
sprawl
means
some
urban
districts
will
have
to
shrink
while
seven
rural
newfoundland
seats
labrador‚s
four
seats
are
protected
will
be
expanded
or
eliminated
but
the
recipe
that
made
it
into
his
cookbook
ludobites
actually
contains
neither
peas
nor
avocados
but
there
is
a
hint
of
quiet
skepticism
within
his
certainty
but
there
is
a
real
risk
that
black
lives
matter
activists
will
confine
themselves
to
protest
‚úbut
there
is
one
area
where
i
have
done
much
thinking
as
well
as
living
it
and
that‚s
the
whole
vexing
issue
of
gay
assimilation
into
the
mainstream
of
american
life‚
he
writes
but
there
is
still
lots
of
room
for
improvement
according
to
the
organization
but
the
remainder
of
the
ascent
apparently
went
well
but
there
may
have
been
other
boots
and
shoes
in
the
cabin
that
were
taken
by
the
pair
but
the
report
is
not
the
only
issue
dominating
the
headlines
in
israel
but
the
request
was
not
approved
due
to
other
planes
above
him
on
the
popular
route
according
to
airnav
indonesias
air
traffic
control
but
theres
a
lesson
here
for
all
of
us
but
theres
a
lot
more
where
dprinters
could
make
a
big
difference
but
there‚s
little
question
that
this
unit
will
be
remembered
beyond
the
playing
days
of
its
stars
just
as
the
great
vikings
steelers
bears
and
ravens
units
of
the
past
among
other
elite
defenses
still
resonate
years
even
decades
later
but
theres
no
happy
ending
to
trying
painkillers
but
the
restaurant
claims
they
make
even
more
but
there
was
a
compromise
but
there
was
hope
but
there
was
no
suggestion
that
bravo
had
verbally
abused
an
opponent
with
the
icc
statement
merely
saying
match
referee
david
boon
had
sanctioned
him
for
using
an
audible
obscenity
whilst
batting
but
there
was
reference
to
an
attack
on
police‚
but
the
risks
are
huge
but
the
scholars
letter
suggests
his
public
contrition
has
not
eased
foreign
misgivings
but
the
scientific
method
is
such
that
we
have
submitted
a
paper
to
a
journal
the
journal
will
consider
it
then
the
community
will
judge
he
told
reuters
but
these
devices
shouldnt
be
considered
just
for
meetings
‚úbut
these
exact
same
issues
have
been
raised
in
other
states
and
the
courts
have
never
invalidated
charter
schools
because
of
them‚
but
these
felt
different
they
were
not
some
selfimportant
actors
hijacking
the
program
for
a
personal
agenda
but
rather
an
acknowledgement
of
the
very
real
conversations
we
are
all
having
right
now
but
the
senselessness
of
the
recent
deaths
has
shaken
the
metropolis
becoming
the
topic
of
intense
tv
coverage
newspaper
columns
denouncing
the
violence
and
conversations
in
juice
shops
cafes
and
cabs
but
the
shakeup
postdebate
cruz
in
second
of
carson
at
fiorina
her
highest
national
poll
showing
of
any
survey
ive
seen
marco
rubio
tied
with
her
at
but
the
signal
may
not
be
a
discovery
quite
yet
but
the
south
african
would
press
on
to
reach
their
target
of
runs
without
any
further
loss
but
the
spirit
of
this
area
has
been
renewed
by
pope
francis
visit
on
sunday
morning
but
the
state
high
court
rejected
that
argument
saying
the
history
of
the
law
the
common
understanding
of
the
words
and
the
need
for
legal
clarity
required
that
the
spouses
must
have
separate
residences
but
the
stock
is
currently
more
driven
by
cloud
computing
services
sold
to
companies
but
the
team
showed
its
limits
in
the
champions
league
losing
on
aggregate
to
barcelona
in
the
quarterfinals
but
the
time
to
intervene
in
syria
was
when
there
was
no
isis
and
syrian
president
bashar
alassad
was
not
supported
by
iran
and
russia
he
said
but
the
touristfriendly
bristol
trail
landed
shaun
in
the
middle
of
political
row
about
the
locations
chosen
with
a
cluster
around
the
city
centre
and
the
wellheeled
clifton
neighbourhood
but
the
true
meaning
of
the
day
is
underlined
by
the
continuing
sacrifices
made
by
us
forces
in
afghanistan
and
other
tense
areas
but
the
tsarnaevs
were
not
on
the
minds
of
most
people
in
boston
on
wednesday
but
the
two
parties
still
overlap
a
great
deal
leaving
the
outcome
if
an
election
were
held
today
little
better
than
a
coin
flip
but
the
unit
still
finished
second
in
the
country
in
total
defense
and
seventh
in
scoring
defense
but
the
un
nuclear
watchdog
the
iaea
remains
dissatisfied
with
unanswered
questions
on
past
possible
military
dimensions
to
the
program
but
the
war
has
regularly
spilled
over
into
lebanon
raising
already
existing
sectarian
tensions
in
the
country
but
the
workers
who
drive
them
are
inevitably
placed
in
harm‚s
way
‚úliterally
waiting
to
be
struck‚
said
robert
roy
president
of
royal
truck
equipment
inc
in
coopersburg
but
they
are
going
on
with
their
normal
activities
despite
the
horror
dws
andy
valvur
reports
from
the
french
capital
but
they
can
also
make
it
too
easy
to
shop
mindlessly
from
bed
waste
time
scrolling
through
facebook
updates
and
put
our
private
information
at
risk
if
we
don‚t
take
steps
to
protect
it
see
previous
tip
but
they
cost
more
than
per
battery
but
they
dont
think
about
the
disability
‚
especially
if
its
not
paid
for
by
the
company
‚
and
thats
your
bigger
risk
but
they
have
it
all
under
control
but
they
have
made
people
reevaluate
when
and
where
and
if
they
still
want
to
dip
into
the
ocean
but
theyre
not
having
the
desired
impact
just
yet
but
theyre
saying
it
wasnt
them
but
they
seem
to
agree
that
our
furry
and
feathered
friends
do
form
strong
attachments
with
each
other
like
the
longtime
mate
of
a
female
gorilla
at
a
zoo
in
boston
massachusetts
but
this
also
was
a
place
where
my
sister‚s
gogo
boots
and
my
brother‚s
‚úblack
music‚
drew
unwanted
attention
but
this
balancing
act
has
been
difficult
but
this
club
has
helped
me
greatly
since
ive
arrived
and
im
very
happy
here
but
this
list
was
apparently
made
by
the
three
uk
schoolgirls
suspected
of
traveling
from
london
to
syria
to
join
isis
according
to
britains
guardian
newspaper
which
has
seen
the
document
‚úbut
this
model
of
education
is
not
likely
to
endure
for
decades
longer
but
this
storm
that
hit
yesterday
it
was
just
so
severe
and
so
sudden
but
this
time
those
called
to
explain
themselves
were
not
just
domestic
opponents
of
last
years
coup
but
thomas
said
its
highly
unusual
to
have
backtoback
accidents
including
a
death
in
recent
weeks
but
those
companies
dont
reap
direct
revenues
from
the
rides
taken
locally
but
those
days
are
over
‚
cleveland
and
king
james
reign
supreme
in
the
east
but
those
public
efforts
have
done
little
to
calm
the
nerves
of
an
anxious
populace
which
now
expresses
little
confidence
the
federal
government
can
prevent
the
type
of
terrorist
attack
that
transpired
in
california
earlier
this
month
but
those
six
minutes
are
the
first
moments
of
the
revenant
a
hollywood
blockbuster
starring
leonardo
dicaprio
set
to
open
in
just
a
few
days
but
those
who
are
living
a
life
that
is
more
or
less
without
need
we
dont
know
how
to
cry
the
pope
said
but
though
their
use
has
decreased
the
weapons
continue
to
be
part
of
the
rebels
arsenal
but
to
focus
on
only
a
few
frontrunners
is
to
neglect
a
huge
portion
of
the
gop
presidential
field
but
to
prove
a
crime
the
government
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
clinton
or
aides
knew
they
were
mishandling
the
information
‚
not
that
she
should
have
known
but
trudeau
has
taken
a
completely
different
tactic
but
trump
also
said
in
an
interview
with
bloomberg
earlier
this
week
that
hes
friendly
with
young
and
even
met
with
him
at
his
office
a
day
after
seeing
young
in
concert
at
carnegie
hall
but
trump
managed
to
alienate
two
of
our
strongest
allies
the
united
kingdom
and
israel
with
one
campaign
trail
statement
but
tuesday
was
reserved
for
patients
or
their
relatives
from
all
walks
of
life
a
mechanic
a
toolanddie
maker
even
the
daughter
of
a
doctor
like
fata
but
turnbull
who
faced
domestic
opposition
pressure
to
speak
out
on
whaling
said
the
row
should
not
be
allowed
to
erode
the
good
will
and
the
rest
of
the
relationship
but
twitter
needs
to
do
more
but
two
days
before
the
vote
he
was
barred
from
participating
in
elections
because
of
allegations
of
corruption
and
leite
stepped
in
to
replace
him
but
two
minutes
into
the
june
launch
one
of
the
struts
in
the
second
stage
of
the
unmanned
falcon
rocket
likely
broke
loose
but
two
months
later
he
is
full
of
paranoia
and
distrust
but
uganda
offers
some
hope
for
the
gentle
giants
but
ultimately
buchanan
says
it
could
be
a
big
problem
for
his
candidacy
and
republicans
overall
but
ultimately
the
restaurant
that
made
your
food
has
a
responsibility
to
you
to
not
poison
you
but
unlike
the
major
us
pork
and
beef
producers
that
were
sold
to
foreign
giants
in
recent
years
american
fishing
fleets
must
be
percent
usowned
according
to
federal
law
but
us
and
french
intelligence
officials
lean
toward
an
assessment
that
the
paris
terror
attacks
were
inspired
by
al
qaeda
but
not
directly
supervised
by
the
group
but
usn
president
ahmed
youssouf
houmed
said
no
progress
had
been
made
since
signing
but
vattenfalls
forsale
assets
in
the
region
are
only
worth
about
half
a
billion
euros
when
costs
to
public
health
and
the
environment
are
factored
in
greenpeace
estimated
but
victims
still
need
to
submit
a
claim
within
three
years
of
the
first
symptom
but
vmware
isnt
going
away
as
a
company
but
voyager
was
only
programmed
to
play
back
its
recordings
for
seconds
twice
a
year
but
walk
a
mile
in
sindees
heels
and
youll
see
the
world
differently
but
we
are
capable
of
it
and
more
than
ready
for
the
task
but
we
are
committed
to
doing
it
in
a
way
that
unlike
unfortunately
what
happened
with
stopquestionandfrisk‚we
will
continue
to
try
and
do
it
in
a
way
that
is
not
alienating
but
rather
gaining
support
for
what
we
do‚
but
we
are
incredibly
proud
of
ronda
but
we
believe
the
security
forces
will
be
able
to
regroup
but
we
cant
ignore
the
impact
this
transition
is
already
having
on
mining
communities
or
the
threat
it
poses
to
the
healthcare
and
retirement
security
of
coalfield
workers
and
their
families
but
we
did
and
here
are
our
faves
learn
how
to
bdsm
for
real
many
in
the
bdsm
community
that
stands
for
bondage
domination
sadism
and
masochism
find
shades
to
be
a
wildly
inaccurate
portrayal
of
their
lifestyle
but
we
dont
know
yet
she
said
but
we
have
a
bigger
movement
today
do
not
be
mistaken
says
eleanor
ellie
smeal
longtime
activist
and
president
of
the
feminist
majority
foundation
‚úbut
we
have
a
moral
and
ethical
responsibility
to
give
patients
the
time
they
deserve‚
but
we
have
one
principle
that
stands
above
all
no
deportation
at
any
price
but
well
come
back
tomorrow
early
to
finish
our
last
hole
but
we
need
to
balance
this
with
the
needs
of
the
vulnerable
and
the
victims
but
were
going
to
have
to
move
on
but
we
will
see
but
what
a
thrilling
two
minutes
but
what
concerns
bugaj
is
not
so
much
the
growth
rate
but
the
relationship
the
polish
economy
maintains
with
the
rest
of
europe
but
what
does
buy
you
but
what
do
these
police
officers
learn
from
seeing
their
actions
on
video
and
then
being
put
on
leave
but
what
if
a
deal
is
made
with
greece
but
what
if
things
don‚t
work
out
between
mom
and
dad
but
what
is
el
ni√o
and
what
impact
will
it
have
this
time
around
but
what
is
increasingly
apparent
is
that
riyadhs
new
rulers
enjoy
more
scope
to
make
dramatic
and
unexpected
interventions
than
their
predecessors
did
‚úbut
what
is
most
damaging
is
the
impact
on
our
reputation
as
a
competent
implementor
‚
we
lost
the
public
trust
‚
because
of
a
flawed
sloppy
and
misdirected
process
by
the
bureau
of
management‚
‚úbut
what
is
really
going
on
is
a
sense
of
resignation
but
what
is
the
economic
return
for
nova
scotia
taxpayers
but
what
thunderhead
doesnt
have
at
the
moment
is
the
kind
of
marquee
customers
who
are
big
name
sexy
companies
who
are
willing
to
put
the
thunderhead
name
in
lights
along
with
theirs
but
when
department
of
justice
prosecutors
announced
the
results
of
the
us
investigation
in
november
they
indicted
two
intelligence
operatives
from
libya
but
when
does
a
theme
park
ride
stop
being
scarily
fun
and
start
being
just
plain
scary
but
when
i
look
beyond
their
great
intentions
at
the
real
results
that
their
organizations
achieve
i
find
myself
wondering
whether
this
word
passion
is
helpful
at
all
but
when
its
becoming
noisy
affecting
the
tenants
life
plus
my
property
value
this
has
to
be
rectified
but
when
it
was
discovered
that
vincent
had
exchanged
notes
with
a
male
friend
the
very
foundation
of
her
place
in
the
family
shifted
violently
beneath
her
feet
but
when
it
was
over
he
asked
her
to
meet
with
him
in
chicago
where
he
offered
her
the
cabinet
position
but
when
it
was
put
into
public
record
in
the
civil
suit
the
judge
sealed
the
records
but
when
jeb
bush
and
hillary
clinton
arrived
at
the
urban
league
conference
in
ft
lauderdale
on
friday
the
first
time
they
have
shared
a
stage
since
only
one
participant
was
itching
for
a
fight
but
when
ronald
koemans
side
hosted
arsenal
on
new
years
day
last
season
it
defeated
the
gunners
with
a
counterattacking
performance
but
when
the
australian
government
proposed
to
bring
in
rules
regarding
plain
packaging
for
cigarettes
the
tobacco
giant
philip
morris
challenged
it
in
court
arguing
that
the
law
was
a
breach
of
the
hong
kongaustralia
agreement
but
when
wolf
ejected
blue
jays
reliever
aaron
sanchez
in
the
eighth
for
hittin
alcides
escobar
gibbons
donaldson
and
volquez
were
at
the
forefront
of
a
benchclearing
fracas
but
whereas
the
work
of
the
original
treuhand
was
accompanied
by
massive
west
german
investment
in
infrastructure
and
largescale
social
transfers
to
the
east
german
population
the
people
of
greece
would
receive
no
corresponding
benefit
of
any
sort
but
while
considered
unlikely
even
that
could
slip
by
without
a
decision
from
the
vice
president
but
while
it
has
recently
made
moves
to
advance
its
nuclear
program
experts
say
it
is
uncertain
whether
it
could
realistically
build
an
atomic
bomb
in
secret
or
withstand
the
political
pressure
it
would
face
if
such
plans
were
revealed
but
while
passage
of
trade
promotion
authority
in
the
senate
is
likely
the
result
in
the
house
where
abe
will
be
speaking
is
less
certain
but
while
police
now
patrol
the
streets
its
sunni
civilians
are
worried
about
the
future
apprehensive
about
the
shiite
militias
that
liberated
tikrit
and
fearful
the
islamic
state
group
could
come
back
but
while
some
boehner
allies
harbor
visions
of
completing
controversial
big
ticket
items
while
boehner
still
wields
the
gavel
the
likelihood
of
a
brisk
legislative
schedule
this
october
is
slim
but
while
the
generational
gap
within
the
brotherhood
has
emerged
as
a
challenge
for
its
battered
leadership
the
problem
is
not
exclusive
to
the
group
but
while
these
are
all
considerations
there
are
other
more
powerful
arguments
against
such
secrecy
but
while
these
takedowns
are
important
this
approach
can
end
up
being
akin
to
a
game
of
whackamole
as
accounts
are
quickly
reintroduced
under
new
names
but
who
cares
about
going
slow
when
there
are
waves
to
ride
but
why
did
so
many
men
drown
but
why
should
we
make
it
easy
for
them
rather
than
being
clear
about
where
we
stand
from
the
beginning
patriotic
and
not
nazi
but
why
would
we
say
any
different
but
williams
said
saturday
that
she
doesnt
share
wozniackis
love
of
running
but
will
the
latest
move
further
embed
it
amid
international
efforts
to
uproot
the
group
but
with
a
video
you
cant
say
its
not
happening
but
with
backup
tarvaris
jackson
held
out
another
week
because
of
a
sprained
ankle
daniels
stepped
in
and
showed
he
can
still
handle
the
offense
running
for
yards
and
throwing
for
‚úit
was
a
blast
watching
him‚‚
carroll
said
of
daniels
but
within
days
mohammad
had
gone
at
least
as
far
as
croatia
but
with
iran
apparently
backtracking
on
key
points
of
the
emerging
deal
the
talks
could
go
past
the
target
date
but
with
so
many
people
looking
for
work
that
competition
has
been
tough
but
workers
were
not
given
the
option
to
vote
on
that
plan
but
would
our
decision
have
been
as
straightforward
had
we
both
been
enjoying
established
careers
but
yeah
we
havent
actually
had
the
chance
to
film
anything
in
chicago
but
yet
again
the
defense
lapsed
and
melvin
lewis
was
left
open
in
the
corner
but
you
dont
ask
him
that
you
cant
ask
him
that
but
you
dont
want
to
take
away
the
aggression
from
teams
but
you
just
got
ta
stay
strong
but
you
know
all
of
this
if
youve
ever
watched
his
shows
but
you
list
the
exact
location
of
where
the
recorder
was
hidden
and
youre
posting
pictures
of
the
locations
too
but
you
must
keep
work
confined
in
some
way
in
however
you
define
your
workday
but
youre
saying
that
if
i
do
pace
then
i
am
a
little
crazy
but
you
see
we
all
are
voting
in
dignity
and
peace
and
i
am
proud

outgoing
interim
president
said

youve
got
to
give
it
to

can
wonder

the

said
lisa
jackson
apples
vp
of
environmental
initiatives
and
former
head
of
the
epa
forests
minister
steve
thomson
was
unavailable
for
comment
for
everyone
elses
sake
were
hoping
reevu
provides
a
clearer
idea
of
how
the
device
actually
works
by
the
time
it
arrives
on
kickstarter
later
this
year
for
everyone
who
wants
to
work
clean
there
are
no
obstacles
for
the
transportation
of
goods
through
the
customs
checkpoints
for
example
a
family
paying
for
gb
at
att
can
get
the
same
amount
of
data
for
if
they
switch
for
example
an
israeli
will
generally
not
try
to
wrap
up
his
arguments
in
a
particularly
sophisticated
way
for
example
a
security
question
which
asks
‚úwho
is
your
favorite
superhero‚
only
makes
things
easier
for
individuals
looking
to
bypass
a
user‚s
security
questions
for
example
he
received
a
message
from
an
individual
claiming
they
were
serving
with
the
marine
corps
in
afghanistan
for
example
if
you
and
your
spouse
want
to
take
an
anniversary
trip
you
both
may
be
more
likely
and
willing
to
cut
back
in
other
places
for
example
imagine
a
company
that
makes
sporting
goods
for
example
in
cairo
the
ministry
of
urban
planning
has
adopted
womens
safety
audits
to
guide
their
development
plans
for
example
its
a
good
idea
to
check
out
floor
samples
for
example
marketers
can
automate
responses
and
outreach
to
customers
immediately
when
an
event
trigger
such
as
joining
a
loyalty
program
or
downloading
an
app
is
activated
for
example
mycorrhiza
fungi
can
increase
the
root
system
improve
its
drought
tolerance
and
improve
nutrition
for
example
oracle
rival
sap
sap
has
been
asking
sun
and
oracle
for
direction
on
the
future
of
java
which
it
uses
to
build
its
products
for
example
physicians
might
receive
faxes
from
a
pharmacist
to
say
ive
immunized
of
your
patients
and
heres
the
faxes
on
it
for
example
pluto
and
charon
may
have
held
onto
their
interior
radioactive
heat
for
much
longer
than
scientists
had
thought
possible
for
example
she
refused
to
go
on
the
sunday
news
shows
in
the
wake
of
the
benghazi
attacks
leaving
susan
rice
to
fill
the
hot
seat
for
example
snake
wont
be
able
to
interrogate
foes
until
hes
actually
recruited
an
interpreter
for
example
the
board
awarded
only
percent
of
hassells
individual
pay
component
for
incentives
after
weighing
a
number
of
factors
for
example
the
fare
from
city
central
to
the
airport
on
the
east
side
would
jump
by
about
to
for
example
the
murdoch
family‚s
st
century
fox
is
an
investor
in
vice
media
while
time
warner
has
invested
in
the
online
news
site
mashable
for
example
the
new
airbnb
card
will
show
you
suggested
listings
for
upcoming
trips
or
remind
you
to
book
a
rental
if
youve
searched
listings
for
a
specific
date
for
example
the
new
yorknewarkjersey
city
metro
area
includes
cities
in
new
york
as
well
as
new
jersey
for
example
there
may
be
a
religious
or
political
belief
structure
that
people
identify
with
in
the
collective
that
makes
up
a
large
part
of
a
persons
sense
of
self
or
identity
for
example
there
were
no
sanctions
on
medical
supplies
but
sanctions
on
banking
and
insurance
operations
meant
that
buying
essential
drugs
became
impossible
forcing
people
to
buy
inferior
or
fake
versions
in
the
black
market
for
example
the
rubin
museum
of
art
in
new
york
city
gives
people
and
older
free
admission
the
first
monday
of
every
month
for
example
while
glucosamine
and
chondroitin
use
is
down
fish
oil
use
is
up

said
a

just
as
important
as

he
felt
that
he
was
‚úthe

adding
‚úin
this
constituency
it
is
a
straight
choice
between
myself

mackinlay
he
said
he
had
been
buoyed
by
calls
to
his
family
and
support
from
all
over
the
league
he
said
he
hoped
the
march
would
send
a
strong
message
to
anyone
committing
violence
to
stop
the
senseless
killings
of
our
young
people
he
said
he
is
certain
that
the
two
countries
can
take
bilateral
relations
to
a
new
height
he
said
hell
be
vying
for
a
chance
at
the
slightly
smaller
top
prize
too
just
like
he
does
every
year
he
said
he
sees
drivers
texting
and
talking
while
driving
all
the
time
and
that
makes
his
job
much
more
dangerous
he
said
he
sped
through
stop
signs
trying
to
get
away
until
down
the
road
he
and
the
suv
driver
came
upon
a
mass
of
police
cars
he
said
he
spoke
with
university
officials
over
the
summer
about
what
accommodations
could
be
made
for
students
who
need
meals
that
follow
religious
dietary
guidelines
he
said
hes
seen
the
neighbourhood
change
over
the

twenty
years

said
he
wants
to
see
work
being
done
for
first
nation
people
in
saskatchewan
and
across
the
country
who
need
it
most
he
said
he
was
hoping
that
firemen
might
arrive
in
time
and
put
up
a
safety
net
but
he
was
forced
to
jump
before
they
had
arrived
after
the
heat
got
too
intense
he
said
he
was
saddened
by
leungs
death
but
declined
to
comment
on
the
killing
he
said
he
will
wear
a
protective
glove
and
be
mindful
of
the
stitches
when
he
faces
his
former
team
he
said
he
wished
that
subsequent
silence
could
erase
a
story
told
out
of
immaturity
he
said
his
company
had
confirmed
that
the
ship
had
left
the
iranian
port
with
all
crew
members
on
board
and
all
of
its
cargo
and
that
it
was
expected
to
arrive
in
jebel
ali
late
thursday
night
or
early
friday
morning
he
said
his
investigators
lead
the
world
in
protecting
the
driving
public
from
vehicle
safety
defects
he
said
his
public
high
school
left
him
unprepared
for
the
rigor
of
his
classes
he
said
‚úi
didn‚t
think
we
did
great
and
the
lads
are
not
happy
with
the
way
things
went
but
that‚s
gone
now
and
we
can
not
do
anything
about
it
he
said
if
something
happens
to
me
can
you
do
me
a
favor
he
said
‚úi
have
been
working
hard
in
identifying
the
bikes
and
their
riders
and
would
appreciate
any
information
people
might
have‚
he
said
in
april
before
formally
declaring
his
candidacy
that
he
supported
a
minimum
wage
he
said
i
spoke
to
some
players
before
i
left
and
some
have
gone
to
other
clubs
he
said
it
had
no
further
details
to
provide
because
the
matter
remained
under
investigation
he
said
i
think
he
said
last
night
they
got
a
guy
in
centre
field
said
volquez
who
is
scheduled
to
start
on
wednesday
in
game
of
the
alcs
he
said
it
in
response
to
questions
from
abc‚s
diane
sawyer
who
asked
whether
republicans
would
continue
their
crusade
to
repeal
the
law
he
said
it
is
her
duty
as
a
government
official
to
comply
with
the
law
he
said
its
inevitable
that
more
and
more
trees
will
come
down
given
their
age
he
said
‚úi
wanted
to
be
part
of
something
new
‚
to
be
involved
in
a
project
at
the
start
of
its
operational
stage‚
he
said
i
want
to
make
this
point
theres
been
conservative
candidates
who
have
been
suspended
and
indeed
a
labour
candidate
in
london
for
fraud
he
said
‚úi
was
right
there
during
labor
helping
her
breathe
every
highly
intense
contraction
every
second
of
pain
right
there
watching
the
actual
birth
cutting
the
cord
and
wiping
the
tears‚
he
said
‚úi
went
to
the
outofhours
doctor
who
said
i
had
a
detached
retina
and
i
was
then
sent
to
queen
mary
hospital
in
sidcup
where
i
couldn‚t
even
see
the
eye
testing
chart
he
said
large
daf
lorries
like
the
one
involved
in
the
crash
no
longer
work
on
pedestrianised
areas
which
are
now
covered
by
box
vans
he
said
legislators
who
didn‚t
support
the
failed
transportation
funding
package
this
past
session
probably
won‚t
do
it
in
an
election
year
either
he
said
loyalists
have
a
strong
presence
in
marib
and
being
a
vast
desert
made
it
an
easier
option
than
mountainous
taez
farther
away
from
the
capital
he
said
members
of
the
paramedic
association
blocked
a
main
highway
to
protest
and
demanded
the
immediate
recovery
of
the
team
members
he
said
moscow
was
also
playing
with
fire
to
use
the
downing
of
the
jet
as
an
excuse
to
make
unacceptable
accusations
against
us
and
accusing
russians
of
mistreating
turkish
citizens
who
were
in
the
country
for
a
trade
fair
he
said
multiple
agencies
will
be
involved
if
the
flu
shows
up
here
he
said
no
actually
that
was
my
dads
bear
that
was
his
pet
and
at
that
point
he
pulled
out
his
fathers
diaries
and
photographs
from
the
war
and
started
to
really
share
the
story
publicly
mattick
said
he
said
no
ones
been
injured
or
killed
by
his
product
he
said
no
vaccine
is
percent
effective
but
the
measles
vaccine
is
very
good
he
said
nuclear
research
would
not
be
frozen
and
military
sites
would
be
offlimits
he
said
officials
specifically
want
to
look
at
why
the
jail
population
is
so
large
when
crime
numbers
are
down
he
said
oilpatch
work
is
always
boom
and
bust
but
this
time
has
been
especially
difficult
he
said
omar
died
in
a
hospital
in
the
pakistani
city
of
karachi
in
he
said
one
of
his
amendments
would
prevent
the
va
from
working
with
organizations
that
he
said
take
aborted
babies
and
sell
them
he
said
one
weakness
of
the
study
is
its
exclusion
of
students
who
had
recently
attempted
suicide
so
it
is
unclear
how
well
the
programs
would
have
worked
for
students
at
the
highest
risk
he
said
parachutes
have
been
deployed
on
cirrus
aircrafts
in
incidents
and
are
responsible
for
saving
a
total
of
lives
including
the
pilot
in
sundays
crash
he
said
police
isolated
him
in
his
office
but
he
could
see
what
was
going
on
as
paramedics
continued
to
work
on
wellman
in
an
attempt
to
stabilize
him
for
transportation
to
hospital
he
said
police
pulled
him
over
because
they
were
convinced
sampson
was
a
major
drug
dealer
based
on
a
tip
from
a
confidential
informant
but
added
that
no
drugs
were
found
in
his
home
he
said
rubios
plan
has
economic
merits
but
political
hurdles
he
said
she
wouldn‚t
have
helped
the
inmates
escape
he
said
staff
from
their
hotel
was
with
them
as
they
waited
to
be
taken
to
a
university
shelter
he
said
that
his
wife
now
was
addicted
to
vicodin
and
had
given
the
painkiller
to
their
son
about
five
times
he
said
that
in
the
s
hungary
sheltered
refugees
from
the
wars
in
the
balkans
regardless
of
ethnicity
or
nationality
but
there
needs
to
be
a
distinction
between
those
fleeing
war
and
those
fleeing
poverty
he
said
that
isis
militants
targeted
christians
some
of
whom
were
abducted
from
the
towns
dar
alyan
monastery
as
well
as
people
believed
to
have
alliances
with
the
syrian
regime
he
said
that
it
takes
a
long
time
for
interest
rates
to
feed
through
so
policymakers
need
to
look
two
years
ahead
he
said
that
the
ride
app
will
be
one
of
a
group
of
projects
that
seniors
in
his
class
can
pick
to
focus
on
as
their
senior
design
project
he
said
that
the
festivals
organizers
are
always
trying
to
strike
a
balance
between
established
acts
and
lesser
known
artists
he
said
the
abuse
of
a
child
charge
is
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
adding
that
detective
work
needs
to
be
done
he
said
the
battle
to
be
chosen
as
the
official
no
campaign
was
a
onehorse
race
with
vote
leave
almost
certainly
going
to
be
selected
he
said
the
bcc
was
waiting
to
see
what
shape
reform
proposals
would
take
and
that
it
was
down
to
uk
politicians
to
explain
to
business
what
reforms
they
would
be
pursuing
from
brussels
he
said
the
biggest
issues
for
his
riding
are
the
doctors
shortage
and
health
care
he
said
the
cause
of
death
is
not
yet
known
he
said
the
company
is
considering
an
appeal
he
said
the
days
of
two
chicken
house
farms
are
over
he
said
the
defences
guilty
pleas
were
hard
won
and
therefore
insincere
he
said
the
designation
of
ebola
as
a
global
emergency
is
also
necessary
to
speed
up
paperwork
for
the
ongoing
experimental
drug
and
vaccine
trials
in
west
africa
he
said
the
elderly
patriarch
was
not
watching
csi
anymore
he
said
the
federal
government
would
coordinate
with
coahuila
authorities
to
assess
the
damages
caused
and
provide
the
necessary
help
he
said
the
fighting
erupted
when
is
advanced
close
to
the
town
but
the
kurds
called
in
reinforcements
and
were
able
to
repel
the
jihadists
he
said
the
government
turns
a
blind
eye
to
sunni
extremists
in
the
country
he
said
the
man
is
believed
to
have
lived
in
the
apartment
am
thai
police
probing
bangkoks
deadly
bombing
say
they
have
discovered
bombmaking
materials
during
a
raid
of
a
second
apartment
on
the
outskirts
of
the
capital
he
said
the
money
was
for
combined
taxes
fees
charges
and
surcharges
‚he
said
the
national
dialogue
was
a
project
to
be
done
by
independent
and
nonpartisan
individuals
not
under
a
political
party
he
said
the
pageant
is
paying
an
undisclosed
amount
for
the
right
to
use
the
song
which
longtime
host
bert
parks
sang
for
years
starting
in
he
said
the
party
is
now
on
a
mission
to
bring
healing
and
unification
in
east
portland
stating
that
it
is
a
matter
that
we
have
to
resolve
he
said
the
presence
of
the
us
army
in
europe
is
not
as
immense
as
it
used
to
be
it
does
not
have
to
be
so
immense
but
our
allies
must
fulfil
the
tasks
they
were
given
he
said
the
price
agreed
was
competitive
with
those
for
gas

neighbouring
ukraine
he
said
the
provincial
government
would
consider
various
measures
including
highway
tolls
in
order
to
deal
with
the
deficit
he
said
the
rating
was
not
higher
because
of
the
upsurge
in
murders
and
williams
was
still
on
a
learning
curve
he
said
the
recovery
was
also
being
slowed
because
many
workers
‚
water
tanker
drivers
electricity
company
employees
and
labourers
needed
to
clear
debris
‚
are
all
gone
to
their

them
refusing

he

there
was
no
way
his
daughter
would
burn
pages
of
the
holy
book
which
has
been
cited
as
the
motive
for
the
horrific
attack
he
said
the
rings
would
have
to
be
sold
on
the
black
market
or
melted
down
he
said
the
situation
has
improved
and
customer
service
agents
are
often
able
to
negotiate
a
better
price
when
people
call
to
question
the
revised
offer
he
said
the
suicide
bombers
were
nigerians
who
came
to
cameroon
as
refugees
he
said
the
talks
revealed
a
shared
sense
of
urgency
given
recent
gains
by
the
islamic
state
extremist
group
and
the
alqaidalinked
nusra
front
and
talk
about
fragmentation
radicalization
and
sectarianism
he
said
the
trial
that

an
outofcourt

the

has
been
winding
up
the
estate
since
he
said
the
us
britain
france
and
other

should
be
supportive
but
he
does
not
believe
in
putting
american
troops
into
combat
there
he
said
the
voter
lists
were
flawed
and
claimed
that
voters
were
being
either
bribed
or
intimidated
he
said
the
womens
legal
team
would
meet
next
week
to
decide
whether
to
appeal
to
frances
highest
court

to
wait
for
a
related
decision
pending
at
the
european
court
of
justice
he
said
they
had
just
moved
in
together
and
wanted
to
get
married
he
said
turkeys
generosity
has
a
special
meaning
in
a
world
where
so
many
borders
are
closed
or
restricted
and
where
new
walls
are
being
built
or
announced
he
said
us
troops
need
to
be
able
to
operate
behind
the
lines
in
iraq
and
support
the
iraqi
security
forces

hes
a
wonderful

model
for

it

says
electric
cars
are
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
alone
they
wont
be
enough
to
curb
greenhouse

given
the
projected
rise
in

for
cars
globally
unless
the
way
they
are
manufactured
changes
he
says
graffiti
spikes
happen
after

with

seeking
retaliation
or
when
a
gangmember
dies
he
says
he
had
nothing
to
do

and

he

a

how
do
you
do
that
how
do
you

about

making

about

how
do
you
not

you

however
a

introduced
in

by

aims
to
change
that
however
a

into

he
said
however
according
to
amnesty
many
use
this
pass
to
travel
through
macedonia
and
onwards
through
serbia
into
hungary
with
transport
subsidised
by
the
authorities
however
a
comres
poll
showed
the
general
public
was
now
more
than
twice
as
likely
to
say
they
have
an
unfavorable
view
of
corbyn
as
favorable
however
a
jump
in
crude
could
be
spurred
by
a
worsening
geopolitical
situation
in
the
middle
east
that
will
lead
to
questions
about
supply
if
a
socalled
geopolitical
premium
creeps
back
into
oil
a
sharp
spike
could
be
in
store
however
allison
said
the
west
oakland
bart
station
will
be
closed
however
a
new
study
from
the
arc
center
of
excellence
in
coral
reef
studies
in
queensland
australia
says
fish
should
be
the
no
answer
on
that
survey
however
another
key
player
will
be
recentlyelected
european
commission
leader
jeanclaude
juncker
who
cameron
last
year
tried
to
block
from
the
role
without
success
however
a
russian
tv
channel
late
on
saturday
quoted
the
wife
of
the
copilot
as
saying
her
husband
had
complained
about
the
planes
condition
however
as
a
species
human
beings
have
been
so
successful
that
we
are
threatening
our
own
basis
for
existence
however
as
australia‚s
maiden
entry
in
the
annual
jamboree
of
the
camp
the
catchy
and
the
corny
watched
by
about
million
people
worldwide
achieving
victory
will
be
tough
‚
and
a
major
upset
however
as
he
indicates
he
is
a
presbyterian
and
is
not
an
active
member
of
marble
the
statement
said
however
as
investigation
continues
they
say
that
could
change
however
as
jahabar
sadiq
writes
online
journalism
is
struggling
to
be
heard
however
as
natural
gas
prices
remain
depressed
for
the
better
part
of
the
last
decade
the
gas
city
keeps
moving
further
away
from
its
wealth
generator
of
the
past
however
as
shakespeare
put
it
to
beat
or
not
to
beat
hillary
that
is
the
question
however
attacks
on
minority
communities
have
increased
with
the
rise
of
the
islamic
state
which
regularly
targets
such
sects
in
syria
as
well
as
sunnis
who
it
says
have
violated
its
interpretation
of
islam
however
azerbaijan
denied
entry
to
several
journalists
and
rights
activists
ahead
of
the
european
games
however
casey
believes
this
is
a
temporary
situation
however
colleges
were
given
instructions
that
programs
that
evaluated
poorly
must
find
ways
to
improve
however
company
workers
at
the
site
near
santa
barbara
were
contending
with
demands
and
distractions
and
couldnt
be
reached
by
plains
personnel
based
in
bakersfield
however
dunga‚s
team
were
unable
to
find
a
second
goal
however
during
the
s
and
s
genetic
analyses
unexpectedly
revealed
that
humanitys
closest
living
relatives
were
chimpanzees
however
elm
said
even
though
the
forgery
business
is
booming
it
looks
like
maybe
the
counterfeiters
have
overdone
it
however
even
in
the
depths
of
the
rain
drizzle
and
fog
at
least
the
snow
was
melting
‚
the
snow
took
a
little
longer
to
melt
along
the
west
coast
of
the
island
where
it
never
really
stopped
falling
last
winter
however
even
the
prosecutor
called
for
him
to
be
acquitted
saying
that
neither
the
judicial
enquiry
nor
the
hearing
have
established
that
mr
strausskahn
is
guilty
however
ferber
still
cautions
runners
who
spend
their
winters
on
the
treadmill
to
cut
their
mileage
in
half
when
they
finally
get
back
out
on
the
road
however
few
observers
share
the
governments
optimism
saying
mistrust
a
lack
of
political
will
and
an
entrenched
culture
of
violence
have
undermined
real
progress
toward
peace
in
the
worlds
youngest
nation
of
million
people
however
fires
outside
that
zone
may
or
may
not
be
fought
depending
on
an
assessment
however
for
reasons
not
entirely
clear
the
actor
won
solely
for
disraeli
however
germany
is
determined
to
maintain
sanctions
against
moscow
despite
some
of
its
key
industries
being
adversely
affected
however
gowdy
on
tuesday
cast
doubt
on
the
reliability
of
the
information
in
the
memos
saying
that
it
had
not
been
vetted
however
he
acknowledges
there
is
evidence
that
the
disease
can
be
prevented
by
increasing
physical
activity
and
losing
weight
which
can
include
restricting
sugary
drinks
however
he
also
said
that
although
eastern
oregon
provides
the
state
with
food
and
fiber
the
west
side
of
the
state
provides
a
tax
base
that
supports
state
services
however
he
also
said
that
only
certain
types
of
foamy
soap
could
be
used
on
the
device
which
will
only
be
sold
in
japan
for
now
however
he
denied
a
motion
by
defense
attorneys
at
the
preliminary
hearing
to
dismiss
murder
aggravated
assault
and
aggravated
battery
charges
however
he
has
failed
to
win
a
six
nations
title
in
four
attempts
finishing
second
each
time
and
critics
have
accused
him
of
being
out
of
his
depth
at
the
world
cup
however
hendrickson
says
journey
will
need
to
be
fitted
with
custom
socks
boots
and
braces
for
her
feet
so
she
can
live
a
normal
and
comfortable
life
in
the
future
however
he
never
made
it
there
after
being
caught
up
in
the
blast
at
aldgate
however
her
campaign
has
launched
an
online
ad
entitled
mark
kirks
outrageous
statements
highlighting
not
only
the
recent
comments
but
exaggerations
he
told
about
his
military
record
that
became
part
of
his
campaign
for
senate
however
he
said
the
airport
is
hoping
the
impact
will
be
minimal
with
number
of
southern
destinations
is
on
the
rise
with
sunwing
adding
a
weekly
orlando
flight
from
deer
lake
however
he
saw
a
lighter
side
of
the
incident
later
posting
that
there
was
heavy
air
traffic
in
italy
on
his
instagram
account
however
his
support
for
a
carbon
trading
scheme
gay
marriage
and
an
australian
republic
have
made
turnbull
unpopular
with
his
partys
right
wing
however
his
words
were
their
value
proposition
was
make
it
whatever
you
want
however
houthi
officials
said
they
were
still
in
control
of
alanad
air
base
which
has
served
as
the
rebel
groups
center
for
operations
in
southern
yemen
however
if
chu
gives
wang
a
consolation
prize
of
a
fourth
term
as
legislative
speaker
the
two
factions
will
cross
swords
as
they
battle
for
dominance
however
if
customers
don‚t
set
up
overdraft
protection
the
bank
still
doesn‚t
penalize
them
and
simply
denies
the
charge
however
if
the
film
turns
out
to
be
a
hit
it
will
be
used
as
evidence
that
you
can
get
away
with
this
kind
of
thing
and
that
you
shouldnt
take
the
risk
of
crafting
a
movie
such
as
this
one
with
ethnicallyaccurate
casts
he
said
however
im
best
known
as
the
cofoundereditor
of
monk
the
mobile
magazine
which
from
i
peripatetically
published
from
the
dashboard
of
my
foot
‚úmonkmobile‚
however
in
three
different
experts
from
the
alabama
department
of
forensic
sciences
couldnt
determine
if
any
of
those
bullets
were
fired
through
the
revolver
taken
from
hintons
home
or
even
if
they
had
been
fired
from
the
same
gun
however
in
an
email
to
cbc
ford
canada
said
there
are
no
technical
service
bulletins
for
model
year
escapes
regarding
paint
flaking
or
bubbling
however
in
the
age
of
information
utilizing
tools
like
hashtags
is
an
effective
way
of
getting
your
messages
out
there
and
spreading
your
activism
world
wide
however
in
the
past
few
weeks
the
general
mood
in
the
oil
market
has
improved
with
most
industry
watchers
saying
prices
could
rise
further
from
now
on
however
in
this
case
the
girls
involved
were
not
suspected
in
advance
however
it
also
has
a
dark
side
however
it
does
not
seem
these
tests
are
necessarily
keeping
people
without
genetic
risk
factors
from
having
the
procedure
however
it
plays
it
the
new
land
grab
is
onfor
both
platforms
and
the
new
app
channels
however
its
a
rule
the
general
director
of
stejulies
sports
and
cultural
centre
refuses
to
bend
on
even
for
a
man
without
a
hair
on
his
head
however
its
unwillingness
to
revise
its
humility
a
few
days
ago
i
searched
the
internet
resources
in
the
search
for
specific
knowledge
however
it
was
something
of
an
exaggeration
however
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
if
the
green
shoots
of
hope
were
to
be
trampled
on
rapidly
by
interested
parties
steinmeier
said
however
just
because
a
lot
of
people
are
familiar
with
albertsons
doesnt
mean
the
stock
is
worth
buying‚or
at
least
not
at
the
price
where
it
is
expected
to
come
public
however
king‚s
fans
last
year
noticed
that
some
performances
were
increasingly
erratic
and
he
canceled
remaining
dates
in
october
after
falling
ill
at
a
show
in
chicago
however
lawrence
also
pointed
out
that
building
with
wood
can
still
have
its
benefits
if
carefully
planned
out
however
many
jamaicans
did
not
support
the
suggestion
of
the
name
change
however
merkel
was
not
in
line
for
the
credit
this
time
with
the
un
refugee
organization
unhcr
and
eritrean
priest
mussie
zerai
an
advocate
for
eritrean
refugees
tipped
as
joint
contenders
for
the
top
spot
however
modifications
had
to
be
made
to
the
engines
to
ensure
that
theyll
work
on
the
sls
however
monaco
‚
who
were
third
in
ligue
last
season
‚
struck
four
times
in
devastating
secondhalf
minutes
to
inflict
a
crushing
aggregate
defeat
on
the
swiss
capital
club
however
nearly
tonnes
produced
annually
only
cover
a
third
of
the
needs
of
the
country‚s
nuclear
power
plants
however
net
profit
after
minority
interests
rose
percent
to
million
egyptian
pounds
million
from
million
pounds
a
year
ago
however
newson
wants
people
to
know
they
can
prearrange
to
have
any
cab
to
pick
them
up
it
does
not
have
to
be
yellow
cab
however
no
one
had
made
it
to
the
summit
in
a
continuous
freeclimb
however
norwich‚s
central
defender
russell
martin
scored
his
third
goal
of
the
season
to
equalize
after
a
mistake
by
goalkeeper
simon
mignolet
at
a
corner
however
not
everyone
feels
included
in
the
neighborhoods
upbeat
comeback
however
officials
are
still
working
with
college
provosts
to
determine
the
minimum
standards
as
well
as
how
to
avoid
capacity
issues
in
the
event
too
many
students
select
primarily
just
one
university
however
officials
say
residents
dont
need
to
take
any
special
precautions
otherwise
however
o‚hare
said
that
october‚s
rally
lost
some
steam
as
the
month
progressed
shifting
from
a
broadbased
surge
that
lifted
most
stocks
to
one
enjoyed
primarily
by
giants
like
microsoft
and
amazon
however
oil
is
just
one
source
of
isis
money
however
on
october
nakhid
was
omitted
from
fifas
final
list
however
over
the
past
eight
years
the
situation
has
become
increasingly
intensified
in
taiwan
however
rajoub
denied
that
abbas
was
involved
in
the
decision
to
drop
the
resolution
insisting
that
the
president
‚úhad
nothing
to
do
with
it‚
however
scientists
have
finally
given
it
a
shot
however
signs
of
divisions
among
the
participants
emerged
quickly
when
ahrar
alsham
one
of
the
most
powerful
rebel
factions
in
syria
released
a
statement
suggested
a
compromise
vision
for
the
countrys
future
remains
far
from
reach
however
since
then
us
exports
and
inflation
have
looked
weaker
more
doubts
have
arisen
over
china‚s
ability
to
beat
back
a
sharp
downturn
and
the
powerful
us
job
creation
machine
of
the
past
two
years
has
ratcheted
back
into
first
gear
however
some
aren‚t
very
confident
that
congress
will
come
to
an
agreement
any
time
soon
however
stocks
can
be
volatile
however
strong
winds
and
continuing
intermittent
showers
again
played
havoc
with
the
field
with
a
number
of
former
irish
open
winners
and
leading
european
stars
certain
to
miss
the
halfway
cut
however
support
for
an
end
to
the
ban
is
growing
in
us
congress
among
republicans
and
democrats
from
oil
states
such
as
texas
however
technology
executives
also
said
that
the
deal
process
itself
is
subject
to
significant
cyber
risk
according
to
of
those
surveyed
however
that
wasnt
on
hassan
noors
mind
as
he
arrived
in
malmo
after
a
fourmonth
journey
from
turkey
however
the
abrupt
uturn
and
admission
that
even
powerhouse
germany
can
not
cope
with
the
record
influx
has
underlined
the
importance
of
the
interior
ministers‚
talks
however
the
agreement
has
not
yet
been
presented
to
the
quebec
cabinet
however
the
air
mass
will
be
unstable
enough
on
friday
to
produce
some
afternoon
showers
in
much
of
the
area
then
clearing
friday
evening
into
a
sunny
saturday
however
the
area
has
burned
previously
however
the
big
numbers
of
refugees
pouring
in
with
every
train
coming
from
salzburg
frighten
him
however
the
central
bank
is
to
remain
vigilant
for
signs
of
renewed
‚úfroth‚
in
the
residential
property
market
on
the
back
of
stillelevated
prices
in
certain
market
segments
it
added
however
the
choice
should
be
simple
granade
wrote
in
her
page
opinion
however
the
clippers
failed
to
close
out
their
western
conference
semifinal
series
on
tuesday
in
houston
where
they
were
pounded
then
fell
apart
in
game
six
when
victory
was
beckoning
as
they
were
outscored
in
the
final
quarter
however
the
coalition
coordinating
nodeforestation
efforts
among
indonesian
producers
‚
known
as
the
indonesia
palm
oil
pledge
‚
is
working
to
help
smaller
firms
and
community
producers
achieve
nodeforestation
compliance
however
the
commission
was
asked
for
its
assistance
with
a
lighting
project
for
the
baseball
complex
however
the
company
said
its
capital
adequacy
ratio
of
percent
is
sufficient
and
that
the
figure
appears
low
due
to
the
way
risks
associated
with
home
loans
are
calculated
in
taiwan
however
the
dust‚s
low
temperature
means
it
gives
off
farinfrared
radiation
making
it
visible
to
the
special
detectors
on
akari
however
the
exclusivity
of
the
explorer
program
the
abject
design
of
the
product
and
its
hefty
price
tag
meant
that
the
last
people
whod
be
wearing
glass
down
lifes
catwalk
were
real
people
however
the
fact
that
puffin
books
reissued
a
series
of
classics
of
children
literature
earlier
this
year
suggests
these
books
have
an
enduring
appeal
even
if
it
is
the
parents
buying
them
on
behalf
of
their
children
however
the
government
delegation
did
make
substantial
progress
in
attracting
direct
foreign
investment
however
the
memory
of
nato‚s
broken
promises
also
matters
because
it
touches
on
the
legitimacy
in
russian
eyes
of
the
international
settlement
established
during
the
german
unification
process
and
the
european
order
that
emerged
in
its
wake
however
the
most
memorable
meetings
have
come
in
the
playoffs
both
also
won
by
seattle
‚
a
victory
at
centurylink
field
in
the
nfc
title
game
in
and
a
triumph
in
a
divisional
playoff
game
last
january
however
the
nation
had
a
de
facto
ban
on
executions
since
until
last
december
when
taliban
militants
massacred
more
than
people
mostly
children
at
a
school
in
the
countrys
northwest
however
the
party
has
not
released
how
the
numbers
were
split
between
the
two
candidates
however
the
point
of
chu
replacing
hung
was
never
about
winning
the
presidency
for
the
kmt
because
that
is
seen
by
many
as
a
lost
cause
at
this
point
however
the
police‚unsurprisingly‚don‚t
see
quite
eye
to
eye
with
dumke
and
newburger
however
the
qa
requirement
came
about
one
of
the
prospective
presidential
candidates
was
not
enthusiastic
about
the
decision
however
there
is
still
a
long
way
to
go
however
theres
a
significant
backlog
of
permit
applications
however
there
will
be
a
tipping
point
when
they
blame
erdogan
for
mismanaging
turkeys
affairs
endangering
its
security
and
turning
a
blind
eye
to
criminal
profiteering
by
his
friends
and
family
however
the
road
to
graduation
is
not
always
an
easy
path
however
the
russian
federation
asked
for
a
sixmonth
prolongation
which
expires
on
september
meanwhile
ukraine
continues
to
collect
evidence
of
russian
aggression
in
its
territory
however
the
similarities
between
the
two
companies
are
undeniable
however
the
socialist
candidate
at
the
byelection
in
doubs
eastern
france
won
by
less
than
three
points
however
the
two
countries
have
diverse
bribery
levels
south
africa
stands
at
just
while
nigeria
is
at
according
to
transparency
international
however
the
upcoming
digital
accounts
will
be
limited
to
savings
accounts
and
other
lowrisk
new
taiwan
dollar
transactions
the
commission
said
however
the
vertebrae
of
the
corpse
was
broken
in
a
number
of
locations
however
this
is
anecdotal
evidence
from
a
single
user
and
there
is
no
guarantee
this
approach
will
work
for
others
however
this
islamic
state
attack
in
the
village
of
alqudeeh
in
the
eastern
qatif
region
targeted
shiites
whom
ultraconservatives
in
saudi
arabia
regularly
denounce
as
heretics
however
this
might
suit
the
needs
of
ultrafrequent
fliers
who
find
themselves
commuting
between
two
given
cities
lets
say
new
york
and
boston
several
times
per
week
however
this
phrase
right
here
is
a
great
way
to
start
a
day
however
tuchel
admitted
prematch
that
the
goalkeeper
question
is
still
open
and
that
roman
weidenfeller
would
start
the
second
leg
next
thursday
however
uber
does
not
pay
the
same
fees
to
operate
in
the
city
or
insurance
costs
as
traditional
taxi
services
however
unlike
in
uganda
where
the
constitution
provides
for
the
enforcement
of
the
right
to
education
in
tanzania
no
law
criminalizes
parents
who
fail
to
put
children
in
class
however
unlike
uber
drivers
will
not
be
able
to
make
a
living
from
ridewith
theyll
be
limited
to
offering
two
rides
a
day
and
will
receive
only
a
small
payment
from
passengers
based
on
distance
traveled
and
a
nominal
car
maintenance
fee
however
we
have
been
waiting
on
the
funding
which
has
not
come
and
from
my
point
of
view
its
just
a
comedy
of
errors
hickling
told
the
gleaner
yesterday
however
when
consumption
is
allocated
by
income
decile
percent
of
the
population
does
not
have
the
purchasing
power
to
meet
the
nutritional
target
however
when
it
comes
to
common
everyday
encounters
with
racism
we
can
take
a
good
lifechanging
bite
out
of
the
everyday
personal
stress
of
racism
by
challenging
our
own
default
assumptions
and
reactions
to
racism
however
when
the
researchers
tested
urine
samples
from
about
teenagers
who
had
never
had
sex
zero
tested
positive
for
the
infection
however
when
waheeda
tried
to
bring
the
infant
to
canada
the
canadian
government
would
not
allow
it
however
with
evidence
mounting
that
little
progress
has
been
made
officials
from
rio‚s
governor
to
the
mayor
have
acknowledged
there
is
no
way
the
water
will
be
clean
ahead
of
the
olympics
however
with
the
newly

nova

thats
all
a
thing
of

always
put
that
kind
of
pressure
on
myself

it‚s
a
team
game

i
figured
if

the
team
would
help
to
get
good
looks
in
front
of
the
goal‚
i
always
said
to
my
mother
the
richer

get
the
better
it
is
for
a

of
people
so
dont
worry
about
it

where

i

be
less

in

he
had
previously
thought
i

i
applaud
south

state
senators
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
governor
nikki
haley
for
their
commitment
and
support
to
the
citizens
of
south

and
the
citizens
of
this
country
he
said
i
argue
that
it
should
be
for
everyone
i
as
a
south
african
know
the
work
of
allister

i
asked
him
about
it
and
he
said
well
im
kind
of
religious
now
elrayah
recalled
adding
that
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
his
devotion
had
crossed
a
line
into
extremism
i
asked
him
more
questions
about
hedda
whether
she
continued
to
live
in
san
francisco
after
they
divorced
and
whether
she
was
still
alive
i
ask
for

i
ask
you
all

ate
a
whole
pizza
in

recalled
i
attended
the
public
schools
nearby
i
became
a

in
english
i
became

of

in
i
believe
for
us
the
most
important
is
to
focus
on
ourselves

believe
now
percent
that
i
have
personally
and
we
as
an
organization
have
absolutely
followed
every
rule
to
the
letter
belichick
said
i
believe
people
should
be
expected
to
know
as
much
about
the
quran
as
they
do
about
the
bible
i
believe
that
having
a
professional
basketball
team
is
a
real
asset
to
our
city
particularly
the
downtown
core
and
helps
make
halifax
a
more
interesting
and
attractive
place
to
live
i
believe
that
normal
politics
will
only
be
introduced
on
this
island
fully
if
sinn

uses
its
influence
and
its
exhortations
to
ensure
that
the
ira
is
put
firmly
out

state

‚úi
believe
that
police
officers
dealing

investigation

any

of

can
learn
from

that
was
done
how
the

was
investigated
and
documented

i
believe
the

believe
there
already

distracted

busy

i
felt

in

tonight
so
i
had
to
give
up
the
idea
of
competing
said
sun
if
enough
political
pressure
builds
on
congress
republicans
might
go
along
with
at

a
temporary
restoration
of
the
subsidies
with
few
or
no
strings
attached
if
they
were
willing
to
take
heat
from
conservatives
about
‚úendorsing‚

getting
a
bachelor‚s
degree
is
meant
to
guarantee
entry
to
an
arena
in
which
jobs
are
plentiful
and
wages
rise
steadily
the

system
has
been
failing

today
can
commit
wrongdoings
in

of
so
much

coverage
if
li

in
any

or
abuse
of

the
public
would
have
known
nothing
of
it
if
governor

we
will
expect

eventually

to

he
might
as
well
cut
the

produce

if
he
has
to

then
he

be

then
something
is
wrong

the

bayne

have
openly
provided
the
detail
he
sometimes
did
would
he
if
he
wins
new
hampshire
if
he
picks
up

he
could
swiftly
consolidate
the

behind
him
if
he
would
come

or
you
had
to
go

your

would
go
up
the

why
should
anyone
else
if
hillary
clinton
cant

an

potential
female

will
ask
how
can
i
flaw
in
the
reasoning
extrapolating
from
one
female
candidates
experiences
to
women
in
politics
more
broadly
is
always
suspect
if
history
is
any

simplicity
will
be
the
determining
factor
of
what
ces

thrive

dive
if
i
can
go
through
this
i
have
nothing
to
complain
about
later
in

says
if
i
could
sit
down
and
talk
to
her
i
would
shake
her
hand
i
would
give
her
a
hug
if
idict
is
as
effective
and
as
simple
to
use
as
prx
claims
apple
needs
to
act
fast
to
avoid
another
controversy
like
the
celebrity
photo
scandal
of
if
i
go
into
the
ditch
maybe
im
going
to
roll
over
i
figured
if
we
have
to
do
all
this
each
week
at
least
we
get
to
eat
brisket
on
weekends
i
figured
that
meant
i
must
not
have
gender
identity
disorder
and
so
i
felt
perplexed
if
i
had
ever
heard
him
extol
the
loveliness
of
a
bagpipe
procession
i
would
have
assumed
he
was
having
an
aneurysm
and
braced
for
impact
if
i
had
my
way
for
instance
the
countrys
prosecutors
like
its
traffic
cops
would
summarily
dismissed
and
replaced
with
new
people
who
are
forced
to
adhere
to
reforms
the
rule
of
law
and
transparency
if
i
hadnt
it
might
have
been
some
time
before
it
reappeared
and
the
cancer
would
have
been
more
advanced
and
potentially
more
difficult
to
treat
if
i‚m
going
to
listen
to
a
new
song
before
i
even
understand
what
it‚s
saying
i
better
be
just
excited
by
the
sound
that
i‚m
hearing‚
i
finished
what
i
had
to
do
onair
and
then
took
out
my
iphone
and
took
video
of
them
if
i
place
that
next
to
data
protection
whats
more
important
for
europe
if
iran
threatens
to
walk
away
from
the

this
often
happens
in
a
persian
bazaar
call
their
bluff
if
it
can
be
moved
theyll
move
it
said
dickerson
if
it
could
make
up

its
industrial
losses
with
a
commensurate
increase
in
the
highvalue

sector

domestic
demand

its

it
would
be
on
a
solid
path

it

not
the

be
it

i
found
a

already
and
its
a
pretty
big
guy
‚úi
found
out
i
had
problems
when
i
was
and
since
then
as
a
family
we
have
had
to
look
out
for
it
i
found
that
going
to
bed
at
night
hearing
the
train
at
night
was
really
sad
because
youre
longing
for
home
youre
longing
for
your
parents
and
each
night
youd
be
hearing
a
lot
of
five
and
four
year
olds
crying
i
found
that
oh
this
person
resembled
me
a
little
bit
if
our
car
broke
down
she
would
say
oh
thats
the
alternator
if
people
werent
trying
to
buy
child
sex
it
wouldnt
be
being
sold
if
police
officers
were
on
regular
foot
patrols
people
would
eventually
become
more
familiar
with
them
and
give
them
more
information
he
said
if
poroshenko
holds
his
ground
and
demand
on
the
implementation
of
the
minsk
agreements
the
fake
elections
will
be
off
the
agenda
the
expert
says
i
frankly
think
it
is
for
our
purposes
today
wholly
inappropriate
and
i
am
not
going
to
blemish
anyones
character
particularly
someones
as
young
as
his
if
replicated
it
could
represent
a
huge
step
forward
in
treating
leukemia
and
other
cancers
if
russia
refuses
to
renegotiate
ukraines
debt
by
the
end
of
the
year
ukraine
would
be
forced
into
default
putting
the
imf
in
a
delicate
situation
if
science
were
on
their
side
it
might
be
a
fight
worth
fighting
if
she
becomes
president
she‚ll
be
the
first
woman
president
we‚d
have
and
i‚d
like
that
if
she
defends
policies
viewed
as
having
contributed
to
the
financial
crisis
daley
said
thats
a
problem
if
she
gets
the
conditions
she‚ll
be
very
tough
to
beat‚
if
she
had
violated
that
it
wouldnt
have
created
any
less
love
if
she
was
released
because
she
showed
repentance
other
criminals
should
be
equally
released
said
yearold
college
student
kim
ryeonghui
if
so
debt
restructuring
would
be
needed
for
example
through
a
oneoff
extension
of
maturities
or
a
haircut
if
somebody
gets
a
hold
of
him
he‚s
going
to
do
really
well
for
them‚
if
someone
comes
to
torpedo
the
agreement
i
believe
the
person
or
entity
should
be
isolated
by
the
international
community
whether
its
the
us
congress
or
anybody
else
if
some
people
acted
individually
the
department
has
not
been
made
aware
and
we
do
not
condone
the
action
if
something
like
that
happens
to
you
at
its
terrible
she
says
if
something
offends
you
you
should
just
look
away
if
so
what
does
that
really
mean
if
steel
prices
go
up
less
steel
will
be
used
if
step
one
is
organizing
a
play
date
for
your
child
step
two
isnt
inviting
the
entire
class
over
for
a
surprise
party
if
stocks
and
houses
start
to
fall
you
tell
me
where
the
money
has
gone
if
successful
he
would
be
only
the
second
fifa
chief
from
outside
europe
and
the
first
ever
from
the
middle
east
if
successful
this
project
may
be
one
of
the
first
to
show
that
certain
conditions
can
begin
to
be
treated
prior
to
birth
leading
to
better
outcomes
for
the
child
she
said
according
to
the
hospital
if
sunlight
is
truly
the
best
disinfectant
then
the
international
community
owes
it
to
pichugin
to
shine
as
much
light
as
possible
on
this
maligned
case
and
thereby
pressure
russian
authorities
to
rethink
his
wrongful
imprisonment
if
terrorists
and
criminals
do
still
get
guns
despite
existing
gun
laws
there
is
no
reason
to
have
gun
laws
at
all
if
that
isnt
enough
and
if
the
computer
is
no
more
than
four
years
old
add
gb
of
memory
if
that
is
the
case
it
could
indicate
that
the
pilots
were
unconscious
if
that
is
the
chief
problem
there
appears
to
now
be
a
ray
of
hope
if
that
may
release
date
sounds
familiar
it‚ll
be
years
to
the
day
after
star
wars
attacked
theaters
if
that
screw
was
filled
with
medicine
it
could
be
used
to
deliver
drugs
at
the
same
time
while
your
bone
is
healing
if
the
absurdity
of
the
kentucky
court
clerk
denying
samesex
couples
marriages
licenses
teaches
us
anything
its
that
even
when
something
seems
pretty
obviously
unconstitutional
there
are
always
stubborn
individuals
who
will
try
it
anyway
if
the
allegation
is
determined
to
be
credible
the
statement
said
authorities
will
determine
next
steps
which
could
include
an
investigation
if
the
argument
in
the
lawsuit
were
successful
the
federal
government
could
in
theory
adopt
any
un
treaty
then
force
the
states
including
oklahoma
to
help
impose
it
the
letter
reads
if
the
chinese
market
were
to
double
from
here
it
would
indeed
be
in
bubble
james
griffiths
of
citi
research
said
in
a
commentary
wednesday
if
the
colonials
have
anything
to
be
confident
about
it‚s
their
goalscoring
ability
lately
if
the
combined
power
of
law
enforcement
agencies
in
the
hundreds
of
countries
where
fifa
does
business
can
not
tackle
its
outrageous
deeds
what
hope
is
there
for
attacking
the
daily
destructive
acts
that
affect
millions
of
people
around
the
world
if
the
comments
on
last
week‚s
recap
are
to
be
believed
so
many
of
you
will
have
skipped
this
week‚s
twohour
grey‚s
anatomy
that
i
might
just
be
recapping
it
for
an
audience
of
one
if
the
company
does
not
abide
by
the
terms
of
the
agreement
the
corporation
could
face
criminal
charges
if
the
company
wants
to
jumpstart
sales
by
offering
higher
quality
products
that
resonate
with
diners
the
company
will
need
to
make
sure
it
has
the
manpower
to
implement
those
changes
without
further
hurting
service
quality
if
the
conservatives
and
the
ndp
contributed
to
his
fall
from
grace
many
of
the
sins
were
his
own
‚úif
the
deal
is
not
good
enough
for
you
walk
away‚
if
the
department
of
justice
feels
that
they
have
to
prosecute
that
as
a
hate
crime
i
dont
think
theyll
find
an
awful
lot

if

wrong
america
could
end
up
in
another

if
the
film
bull
durham
taught
us
nothing
else
its
that
you
have
to
respect
the
streak
if
the
free
mixtape
is
eventually
cannibalized
by
a
forprofit
one
it
will
be
because
the
way
we
listen
to
music
has
shifted
if
the
french
president
asks
me
to
think
about
what
more
we
can
do
then
its
our
task
to
think
about
that
and
we
will
act
quickly
merkel
said
adding
that
the
islamic
state
cant
be

with
words
it
must
be
fought
with
military
means

the
government
were
ultimately
to
blame

unsuccessful

we
have
been
successful
in
exposing

serious
flaws
that
offend
the
basic
concept
of

kinda

right
then

there
that

i
knew
it
would
be
me
and
it
was
a
combination
of
me
and
also
because
i
have
the
highest
amount
on
my
head‚
i
knew
i
wanted
to
use
instant
film
and
so
i
decided
to
take
a
walk
around
my
neighbourhood
and
just
take
shots
along
the
way
i
knew
my
legs
were
gone
i
knew
my
notes
werent
as
good
as
they
should
be
always
rushed
i
knew
the

was
up
i
knew
there
was
a
phenomenal
opportunity

says
i
know
from
looking
at

observing
her
her
reaction
it
wasnt
good
i
know
i‚m
as
surprised
as
you
are
i
know
in
my
heart
that
this
was
not
a
choice‚
his
wife
bridget
turner
wrote
in
a
public
facebook
posting
days
before
the
funeral
i
know
it
may
sound
a
bit
counterintuitive
but
i
decided
to
place
my
own
personal
development
and
interests
as
a
priority
i
know
one
guy
who
has
flown
them
in
africa
and
australia
who
thinks
its
a
great
aircraft
i
know
people
who
are
taking
drugs
because
they
have
been
waiting
for
years
and
still
dont
know
what
will
happen
to
their
asylum
request
he
said
i
know
shes
the
type
of
fighter
that
i
want
to
test
myself
against
i
know
someone
who
can
get
that
done
for
us
right
away
i
know
that
the
politics
around
trade
can
be
hard
in
both
our
countries
but
i
know
that
prime
minister
abe
like
me
is
deeply
committed
to
getting
this
done
i
know
the
family
of
michael
tierney
are
so
grateful
for
the
help
and
support
of
the
community
‚úi
know
their
league
form
isn‚t
great
and
i
am
sure
they
will
be
dangerous
opposition
on
saturday
after
a
tough
defeat
at
home
against
oxford
i
know
the
left
wants
to
make
this
into
an
attack
on
religion
and
thats
not
what
this
is
i
know
this
is
a
western
country
and
people
wont
like
it
but
those
are
the
instructions
from
the
rcmp
i
know
this
seems
misleading
to
you
but
it
is
meant
as
more
of
a
visual
effect
more
than
an
accurate
location
of
drivers
in
the
area
wrote

i

the

a
perfect

liked
eileen
in

however
im
starting
to
see
a
dark
insecure
cynical
side
to
her
that
will
become
her
downfall
i
like
having
a
bit
of
pressure
added
the
attacker
i
like
her
because
she
puts
up
with
all
the
muck
that
gets
thrown
at
her

‚úi

literally
made
a

with
my

it

never

i
felt
so
cocky
i
lived
in

for

ill
be

owning
hundreds

slowly

fact
that
im
still
lucky
enough
to
be
here
to
celebrate
and
unfortunately
others

look
around

sure
enough
a
young
japanese
couple
in

is
placing
an
order
at
a
touch

kiosk
that
looks
a
little
incongruous
in
such
an
opulent
setting
i
look
at
who
might
be
able
to
step
up
and
take
on
those
challenges
and
to
me
i
see
a
lot
of
good
people
out
there
but
i
see
gaps
he
told
conservative
talkradio
host
charlie
sykes
i
looked
across
the
road
and
saw
people
on
the
cafe
terrace
falling
over
i
looked
around
and
there
was
nothing
but
land
i
looked
at
him
and
realised
this
man
as
my
boss
and
the
man
that
signed
my
time
sheets
was
never
going
to
advance
on
me
i
looked
at
their
faces
and
thought
that
makeup
is
really
good
he
remembers
i
look
forward
to
getting
to

how
much
you
could
save
if

often
bombed

you
constantly
run
the
risk
of
getting
sniped
at
or
threatened
at

no

allergic
to

which
results
in
a
nasty
reaction
around
my
eyes
but
when
i
was
away
the
cat
had
come
into
my
room
and
sat
on
my
pillow

emma

lived
as
a
weekday
lodger
with

enough
calories

an
expert
in
business
growth

overcoming
organizational
obstacles
to

and
a

a
preachers
daughter
and
this
is
the
hardest
thing
ive
ever
had
to
do
in
my
life
she
added
i‚m
assuming
not
because
the
above
winners
yes
even
the
best
ones
would
make
you
think
golden
globes
songs
are
reserved
only
for
anthems
of
sorrow
im
a
strong
advocate
of
choosing
foods
that
match
the
season
but
making
simple
yet
scrumptious
soup
out
of
any
veggie
goes
great
with
heavier
food
and
cold
days
‚úi‚m
at
a
loss
for
words
im
a
third
year
student
and
i‚m
about
to
graduate
so
i
decided
to
tell
my
teacher
because
if
i
had
ruined
our
relationship
at
this
late
stage
it
wouldn‚t
have
mattered
that
much
imax

he

at
that
time
i
dont
even
think

go
and
buy
those

palson
said
so
it
wasnt
as
simple
as
going
out
to
a

picking
up
a
jersey
and
wearing
it
palson
said
i

he
came
from

i
dont
have
any
white
in

im
kind
of
mad
because

its
obvious
i

it
was
obviously
a
scary
incident
lippert
added
i
mean
look
where
can
you
throw
it
anymore
i
mean
my
main
character
is
brazenly
unapologetically
bisexual
and
you
dont
see
a
lot
of
characters
like
that
in
either
socalled
cinema
or
queer
cinema
i
mean
thats
something
you
can
only
dream
about
i
mean
to
be
her
size
she
hits
so
hard
and
she
plays
so
well
the
american

here
in

to
help

economic

this

another
great
example
of
things
we
are
doing
to

both
of

argue
that
most
who

died
over

at

a
little
bit
i
might
not
have
as
many
options
if

indeed
even

of
the

we
make
indeed
facebook
itself
had
its
own
issues
this
year
when
its
year
in
review
feature
surfaced
painful
memories
of
deceased
loved
ones
for
users
so
its
not
surprising
to
see
the
company
taking
steps
to
avoid
that
happening
again
indeed
he
has
been
widely
praised
for
his
teaching
and
beloved
particularly
by
his
research
assistants
many
of
whom
have
gone
on
to
important
careers
in
practice
academia
and
politics
indeed
it‚s
been
half
a
century
but
that
game
of
tug
of
war
is
still
going
on
indeed
new
america
has
studied
the
backgrounds
of
some
usbased
militants
since
who
have
been
indicted
in

convicted
of
some
kind

jihadist
terrorist

indeed
one

appearances
before

was

his

doug

indeed
saudi
motives
in
yemen
likely
have
nothing
to
do
with
protecting
the
countrys
legitimate
government
its
constitution
or
its
electoral
process
indeed
the
political
answer
to
any
and
all
economic
problems
seems
to
be
to
fire
up
the
engine
of
unsustainable
economic
growth
in
such
a
way
that
the
only
possible
impact
can
be
further
environmental
destruction

were

abdeslam
who

the

said

believe
he
may

at

because
a

found
at

scene
showed
he
purchased

before

investigators
believe

said

concluded
the

failed
to
maintain

of

after

still

about
how
i
didnt
want
her
to
post
my

on

because
of
copyright
issues
i
remember
thinking
about
it
then
and
kind
of
weeping
i
remember
when
i
was
in
prison
my
family
did
all
they
could
to
keep
it
out
of
partisan
politics
she
said
i
reply
oblivious
to
her
hostility
since
shes
quite
aggressive
at
the
best
of
times
i
respect
and
understand
those
who
oppose
it
but
i
have
become
convinced
that
it
is
more
dangerous
to
israel
america
and
our
allies
to
walk
away
in
the
face
of
unified
worldwide
support
i
respond
by
asking
the
critics
whether
they
have
a
better
idea
for
bringing
together
countries
that
fought
against
each
other

take
it

i
talk
to
him
all
the
time
i
talk
to
him
like
he
is
a
child
when
i
groom
him
it
all
comes
back
to
realworld
application
and
mental
math
it
all
just
stinks
it
all
proved
too
much
for
mccain
who
tore
into
the
protesters
it
all
started
when
prices
father
jerry
got
in
touch
with
the
league
it
almost
goes
without
saying
but
the
cumulative
impact
of
the
stronger
dollar
is
important
to
watch
it
also
allows
workers
to
challenge
disparities
in
pay
between
people
doing
similar
jobs
or
doing
the
same
jobs
at
different
work
sites
for
the
same
company
it
also
bears
mentioning
that
the
company
has
never
published
any
peerreviewed
papers
in
medical
journals
discussing
its
methods
or
demonstrating
how
its
results
compare
with
traditional
methods
it
also
brings
out
a
seller
that
was
on
the
fence
and
even
if
it
doesnt
work
for
my
buyer
it
may
be
just
what
someone
else
is
looking
for
it
also
calls

expanding
inhome

connections
with
countries
in
the
gulf
africa
and
europe
to
buy
weapons
and
ammunition
in
violation
of
a
un
arms
embargo
it
also
comes
months
after
the
pentagon
dismissed
such
counts
as
simply
not
a
relevant
figure
in
the
fight
against
the
islamic
state
group
it
also
correctly
states
that
sga
president
elliott
spillers
will
serve
only
four
months
before
his
term
as
president
ends
it
also
denied
that
taliban
fighters
were
behind
the
attack
it
also
drags
irans
rd
program
out
into
the
light
of

subjecting
it
to
the
most
intrusive

regime
in

also
establishes
a
special
criminal

try
serious

also
expanded

all
service
workers

literally
of
the
jamaican
state
it
also
offers
custom
alerts
to
warn
you
when
you
edge
close
it
also
once
again
demonstrates
the
brutality
of
isis
which
is
responsible
for
thousands
of
abuses
against
the
syrian
and
iraqi
people
the
security
council
said

also
plans

also
produces

lamborghinis

the

sells
for
to
it
also
provides
commonsense
exemptions
for
isolated
ponds
and
agricultural
or
roadside
ditches
most
of
which
epa
has
indicated
it
never
intended
to
cover
it
also
rallied
because
of
strong
data
on
its
big
osteoporosis

that
is
in
phase
trials
that
would
be
submitted
to
the
fda
for
approval
by
the
end
of

it
also
reproaches
russia
and
the
separatists
for
failing
to
release
all
the
ukrainian

they
are
holding
it
also
says
peers
should
be
appointed
to
reflect
the
share
of

votes
at
general

it
also
shows
companies‚
subsequent
efforts
to
deleverage
their
balance
sheets
by
repaying
debt
rather
than
taking
on
new

it
also
shows

getting
their
start
in

of
the

it
also
suspends
the

through

it
also
took
me
a
while
to
get
the
references
and
jokes
about
morgan
freemans
prolific
voiceover
narration
it
also
took
on
an
additional
layer
of
cultural
significance
when
the
secret
informant
in
the
watergate
scandal
went
by
the
pseudonym
deep
throat
it
also
touched
briefly
on
succession
concerns
surrounding
yearold
king
bhumibol
the
worlds
longest
serving
monarch
who
is
revered
but
ailing
it
also
triggered
deep
soulsearching
about
the
treatment
of
women
in
a
country
where
rape
victims
are
often
stigmatised
and
frequently
pressured
by
police
and
relatives
to
drop
allegations
it
also
wants
to
raise
its
allocation
to
real

it
also
won
a
best

it‚s

clearly
which
of

‚úit
boggled
my

get
into

this
when
they
have
known
for

that
the
melloroos

it
briefly
freaked
out

it
bucked

‚úit
can
range
from

really
help
your

your

if
you
take
time
to
consider
the
ways
you
are
thinking
and
behaving
and
decide
what
is
helpful
and
unhelpful
what
needs
to
change
and
what
you
want
to
keep
steady
it
can
take
a
generation
to
build

strong
capable

that
is
going
to
win
this
sort
of
campaign‚
it
caused
two
upper
floors
to
collapse
into
the
basement
of
the

it
certainly
was
a
situation
that
i
hadnt
played
in
very
much
playing
a
different
role
obviously
still
playing
with
so
many
great

your

just
the

half
hour

so
the

for

just
finally
gave
up
and
then
i
had
to
push
it
like
a
lawn
mower
he
said
it
claimed
the

wrongly
claimed
the

had
refused
to
attend
the

camp
and
had
also
sent
the

home
it
climbs
up
to

above

it
comes
after
a
long
tense
day
countdown
and
an
even
longer
fight
to
curb
the
spread
of

it
comes
as

by

gearing

from

that

comes
in

for

another
for

two

promised

the

response
to

intransigence
suggesting
patience
for
continuing

of

running
out

comes
with
an
additional
counterterrorism
text
books
in
english
and
is
arguably
the
most
comprehensive
curriculum
against
terrorism
to
date
it
concerned
me
that
he
was
going
for
that
weapon

presumed
he
had

it
concluded
that
the

it
continues
the
verdict
confronts
the
eus
leadership
with
one
of
its
most
severe
crises
of
confidence
and
leaves
greece
facing
potential
financial
collapse
and
exit
from

it

also
prompt
a
renewed
flurry
of
takeover
bids
for
european
rivals
with
syngenta
ag
the
most
likely
target
it
could
also
suggest
that
employment
increased
in
industries
that
did
not
have
as
significant
an
impact
on
gdp
it
could
be
seen
as
a
risky
way
to
make
a
living
but
as
far
as
samir
is
concerned
he
doesnt
have
anything
to
lose
it
could
be
the
cause
of
somebody
getting
stabbed
or
getting
hurt
he
said
it
could
happen
that
someone
with
a
criminal
record
easily
passes
the
border
checks
because
that
information
hasnt
made
it
into
the
databases
it
could
last
several
days
it
counted
what
i
have
qualitative
evidence
for
what
does
it
mean
to
be
doing
something
on
a
daily
basis
that
you
kind
of
think
is
not
good
for
you
it
definitely
met

it
definitely
wasnt
easy
to
push
through
and
to
see
the
silver
lining
in
everything
‚úit
delights
me
to
see
women
of

constant

the
ukrainian

all

have
made
the

a

from

a

southern

across

it
depends
how
you
measure
our
moment
‚úit
depends
on
how
long
it
has
been
since
last
you
were
harmed
it
depends
on
other
causes
which
fall
outside
of
our
business
it
dictates
what
we
should
look
like
to
feel
beautiful
and
loved

did
not
give
a

for
the
talks
it
didnt
take
sem
long
to
snap
out
of
its
recent
funk
it
didnt
work
last
time
it
did
wake
me
up
and
it
woke
my
wife
up
it
was
a
loud
bang
he
said
it
does
good
work
at
committee
producing
decent
reports
but
hardly
anybody
reads
them
it
does
make
you
wonder
what
was
it
like
for
him
it
does
not
leave
a
very
nice
image
‚úit
does
not
need
to
be
an
excellent
one
but
just
a
normal
one‚
it
doesnt
appear
a
public
beach
will
be
coming
back
to
the
city
anytime
soon
it
doesnt
bind
countries
however
to
meet
their
climate
targets
and
it
also
doesnt
prescribe
exactly
how
they
should
get
there
it
doesnt
guarantee
us
anything
on
this
one
but
its
tough
it
doesn‚t
help
that
ceos
are
generally
called
back
in
times
of
crisis
it
doesnt
make
sense
to
wait
until
we
reach
the
federal
health
standard
when
we
know
theres
no
significant
storms
in
sight
and
the
air
quality
will
continue

come
and
have
a

enabled

to
have
a
direct

with

it
ended
because
we
came
up
with
something
better

those

it
has
to
be
a
multicountry
effort
it
helped
that
he
had
all
the
genius
insights
to

i
think
a
key
factor
was
this
focus
and
concentration
and
determination
kennefick
said
it
helps
us
protect
ourselves
and
lets
us
know
when

i
think
afterwards
late
in
the
game
he
started
to
really
feel
it
activate
kind
of
and
it
got
worse‚
i
think
all
that
enters
i
think
almost
every
one
of
the
polls
that
people
are
still
taking
percent
of
the
people
in
the

are
undecided

think
a
lot
of

was
fatigue

stated
i
think
any
time
you
just
get
different
energy
in
there
it‚s
going
to
be
different
which
is
really
what
i
was
hoping
for
i
think
april
and
brett
may
fare
well
from
having
this
harsh
experience
early
on
i
think
as
long
as
runners
are
mindful
of
other
cyclists
as
treat
themselves
basically
like
slow
bikes
theres
no
reason
we
cant
share
the
bike
lane
i
think
every
round
unless
i
shoot
under
par
im
probably
going
to
say
hey
i
knew
it
could
have
been
better
i
think
for
me
it
wasn‚t
necessarily
the
technology
i
think
he
may
owe
an
apology
to
the
families
of
those
who
have
sacrificed
in
conflict
and
those
who
have
undergone
the
prison
experience
in
serving
their
country
said
mccain
i
think
he
signed
his
donation
card
and
he
said
dad
would
give
anyone
anything
she
told
cbc
radios
on
the
go
i
think
hes
putting
himself
in
a
situation
that
hes
not
only
going
to
be
challenged
again
and
again
but
that
hes
going
to
create
some
internal
opposition
that
in
the
end
could
topple
him
i
think
i
can
make
it
happen
by
five
years
from
now‚
i
think
if
you
do
a
story
about
this
well
get
business
from
the
people
who
arent
fans
of
muslims
i
think
it
embarrasses
him
to
play
like
this
but
he
knows
deep
down
inside
that
he
can
get
it
done
said
azinger
who
has
become
one
of
the
most
acclaimed
golf
analysts
on
television
i
think
it
eviscerates
what
medicine
is
intended
to
be
i
think
it
happens
in
real
life
soering
had
told
his
questioners
of
false
confessions
i
think
it
is
likely
that
they
could
move
northwards
on
their
own
if
suitable
habitat
were
available
to
move
in
to
‚úi
think
it
is
worthwhile
to
pursue
this‚
i
think
itll
be
probably
a
bit
sombre
he
said
i
think
it
means
several
things
i
think
its
a
formula
for
the
country
i
think
its
a
human
rights
issue
i
think
its
a
myth
that
expansions
die
of
old
age
i
think
it‚s
better
to
hear
the
body
hit
right
i
think
its
escalated
said
liam
grier
while
waiting
for
a
bus
‚úi
think
it‚s
important
from
time
to
time
to
do
exactly
what
he‚s
doing
which
is
to
visit
other
nations
in
the
world
to
understand
what
they
think
about
america‚
i
think
its
important
in
any
budget
said
martin
i
think
its
important
that
we
all
understand
that
and
come
together
i
think
it‚s
important
to
promote
cultural
exchange
as
a
means
of
building
mutual
understanding

educational
opportunities
are
a
great
way
to
achieve
this
goal

been
in

at

i
feel
like
ive
learnt
a
lot
explained
the
yearold
‚úi
think
it‚s
just
sad
commentary
and
it‚s
gone
to
a
pretty
low
level
i
think
its
more
important
than
ever
for
anyone
in
any
position
where
people
are
listening
to
them
and
hearing
them
that
we
reinforce
what
makes
canada
so
special
and
so
tolerant
and
cohesive
i
think
its
one
of
the
worst
missing
persons
cases
in
history
margaret
lamanna
told
dateline
nbc
i
think
its
probably
terribly
important
to
listen
i
think
its
such
a
nice
touch
and
anything
that
makes
fitness
easier
is
great

think
its

ambien
that

you
might
go
out
to
eat
and
not
remember
said
one
patient
in

think
it

be
a
bit
naive
to

that
the

went
great

jade
cambron
i
think
it
would
be
good
for

think
it

take
our
freedom
for

palladino
stated
i
think
more
than
anything
instead
of
just
putting
a
number
on
it
we
need
to
trust
what
our

are
telling
us
and
what
the
kid
is
feeling
i
think
my
resignation
probably
comes
as
a
relief
to

it
is
in
my
best

and
those
of

will
come
to

to
make

i
think
that
a
wellregulated
market
with
three
operators
would
function
very
well
with
four
operators
it
can
operate
but
its
more
complicated
and
it
will
require
cooperation
between
operators
richard

i
think
that
government
itself
is
struggling
to
try
to
come
up
with
these
new
regulations
he
said
‚úi
think
that
is
a
realistic
goal‚
i
think
that
its
a
very
fair
test
and
you
hit
good
shots
you
get
rewarded
and
you
hit
shots
like
i
did
on
a
few
holes
you
get
penalised
i
think
thats
a
big
big
misconception
i
think
thats
my
biggest
improvement
i
think
that
someone
like
derek
jeter
or
alex
rodriguez
who
has
made
half
a
billion
dollars
in
his
career
doesnt
really
need
a
favor
from
a
normal
civilian
and
a
fan
like
me
‚úi
think
that
success
is
a
lot
more
sweet
when
you
kind
of
go
through
hardship
like
we
did
the
first
couple
years
that
i
was
up
here‚

i
think
thats
why
it
has
caused

he
said
i

that
the

at

falling
was
a
bigger
deal
than
the
actual
price
i

that
ultimately
were
going
to
be

max
said
i
think
that
what
they
have
learned
over
the
past
few
months
and
past
few
weeks
in
particular
is
how
each
individual
in
the
community
can
make
a
difference
he
said
i
think
that
when
knowledge
is
power
and
to
make
sure
i
know
whats
going
on
and
what
steps
are
being
taken
to
make
things
safer
for
me
and
for
her
i
think
that
while
some
people
are
excited
by
fat
jokes
and
stupid
jokes
that
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
people
in
the
general
election
‚
independents
as
well
as
probably
many
of
uh
women
voters
arent
really
that
entertained
by
this
paul

i
think
the
atmosphere
is
a
nervousness
i
think
the

is
unwilling
to
face
the
fact
that
michael
brown
was
a
bad
actor
i
think
the
department
of
tourism
the
department
of
commerce
will
now
reach
out
further
and
pull
from
the
private
sector
more
and

but
i
dont
think
they
will
says
yearold
isabela
who
works
for
paris
city
hall
and
declined
to
give
her
last
name
i
think
the
most
important
part
is
that
were
seeing
a
suspicious
signal
in
the
data
and
then
the
rest
is
kind
of
one
step
at
a
time
vachaspati
said
i
think
the
public
has
been
immune
from
having
to
deal
with
predators
i
think
there
is
an
inherent
risk
in
that
‚úi
think
there
should
be
a
support
dog
for
every
person
boy
or
girl
who
is
going
through
anything
rough‚
she
later
wrote
in
a
letter
to
zebra
staff
i
think
the
running
game
is
so
much
better
palmer
said
i
think
the
strength
is
the
depth
of
it
he
said
i
think
the
water
company
should
put
in
a
pipe
system
that
is
adequate
i
think
the
whole
thing
with
truth
with
gerry
was
not
hiding
anything
‚úi
think
the
ypj
girls
they‚re
the
real
heroes
because
they‚re
not
just
fighting
isil
they‚re
fighting
for
women‚s
rights‚
i
think
they
responded
very
well
and
i
think
thats
the
biggest
reason
why
i
got
the
job
mackanin
said
i
think
they
were
trying
to
put
a
message
across
to
the
young
fellows
that
they
can
come
and
do
this
whenever
they
want
just
based
on
hearsay
i
think
this
is
a
sign
of
hope
for
the
entire
world
and
we
all
know
this
is
very
much
needed
in
this
time
the
eu‚s
top
diplomat
federica
mogherini
said
ahead
of
the
meeting
i
think
this
is
where
most
people
probably
look
at
the
person
in
uniform
and
they
probably
say
okay
this
is
the
guy
who
is
now
going
to
tell
us
we
need
to
build
more
jails
and
make
tougher
laws
i
think
this
process
stinks
he
said
i
think
this
was
an
experience
that
was
new
and
challenging
particularly
for
younger
employees
who
had
never
been
through
an
anomaly
i
think
those
images
got
very
much
stuck
into
my
deep
psyche
i
think
to
put
the
rates
up
even
a
couple
of
dollars
thats
a
couple
of
dollars
per
time
you
get
in
the
cab
i
think
venus
and
serena
have
both
said
if
you
look
good
youll
play
good
says
rothenberg
‚úi
think
we
all
feel
like
weirdos
for
different
reasons
i
think
we
have
heard
from
at
least
three
or
four
cities
and
stadiums
in
germany
about
hosting
a
game
waller
said
i
think
we
have
to
change
it
i
think
we
need
to
develop
a
consensus
about
how
to
approach
this
without
hollowing
out
our
industrial
core
without
taking
jobs
away
from
people
without
creating
more
hardship
for
the
middle
class
of
this
country
bush
said
i
think
we
need
to
get
our
priorities
straight
and
think
more
about
the
individuals
rather
than
the
outward
appearance
of
our
society
and
culture
and
in
reaction
to
yesterdays
incident
ive
been
hearing
a
lot
of
how
does
this
make
us
appear
i
think
we‚re
at
the
point
in
the
season
where
they‚ve
seen
a
lot
of
our
adjustments
and
a
lot
of
the
concepts
i
think
we
regard
this
as
the
gold
standard
test
of
its
kind
i
think
we
should
be
wary
of
asking
gigantic
walled
gardens
like
facebook
and
reddit
to
enforce
rules
about
bad
speech
i
think
weve
got
to
stay
focused
weektoweek
and
i
know
thats
not
what
you
all
want
to
hear
‚úi
think
we‚ve
learned
from
that
mistake
don‚t
poke
the
bear‚
i
think
what
makes
it
particularly
hard
is
that
kids
dont
often
have
that
maturity
to
be
able
to
intellectualize
about
it
‚
to
say
well
even
though
im
doing
this
for
my
mother
she
did
this
for
me
at
one
time
rabins
said
i
think
what
shes
done
has
been
really
special
for
new
orleans
i
think
whats
hes
done
is
to
do
whats
required
to
go
to
the
first
film
everyone
loves
and
identifies
with
and
bring
it
to
a
new
generation
i
think
whats
important
for
people
to
understand
is
that
we
still
have
a
commitment
to
priority
hiring
in
the
northwest
territories
i
think
what
we
need
to
focus
on
now
is
who
we
do
have
here
and
instill
the
value
of
education
in
them
not
just
as
teachers
but
as
parents
at
home
i
think
women
all
over
this
country
heard
very
clearly
what
mr
trump
said‚
i
think
youll
see
some
good
scoring
i
think
putting
will
be
more
important
than
driving
he
told
reuters
i
think
your
experience
and
your
example
of
suffering
and
service
is
something
that
would
be
sorely
missed
in
the
race
said
the
comedian
who
suffered
tragedy
himself
as
a
child
when
his
father
and
two
of
his
brothers
died
in
a
plane
crash
i
think
you
should
take
advantage
of
the
stock
discount
to
get
some
exposure
to
this
classic
american
brand
it
holds
more
toppings
i
thought
about
the
car
in
the
garage
thing
and
i
thought
who
was
going
to
have
to
find
me
i
thought
girls
wanted
effete
little
things
not
big
burly
manlylooking
men
i
thought
thats
what
he
did
‚úi
thought
there
was
room
for
a
progressive
candidate
to
talk
about
the
issues
with
the
frontrunner
secretary
clinton‚
chafee
and
also
a
former
mayor
and
us
senator
told
the
station
i
thought
we
had
a
couple
more
a
chances
i
thought
we
worked
really
well
together
it
hurt
that
i
wasnt
being
heard
and
it
hurt
because
the
faith
i
was
trying
to
push
away
wouldnt
let
go
of
me
it
inappropriately
singles
out
students
for
disparate
treatment
and
will
make
it
much
harder
for
students
to
find
appropriate
housing
said
steven

invalidates

national

of
killing
a
policeman

had
tried
to
arrest
him
for
smuggling

according
to
the
interior
ministry
it
is
times
lighter
than

as
strong
as

it
is

with
multimillion

forced
to
sit
in

rain
while
the
networks
try
to
sell
the
rest
of
us
razor
blades
and
range
rovers
it
is
a
big
question
it
is
about
keeping
really
well
organized
it
is
absolutely
critical
to
end
all
incitement
to
end
all
violence
and
to
find
a
road
forward
to
build
the
possibility
which
is
not
there
today
for
a
larger
process
kerry
told
reporters
as
he
and
netanyahu
posed
for
pictures
it
is
a
completely
irregular
untimely
and
unjustified
procedure
the
institute
said
in
a
statement
it
is
a
concern
obviously
for
his
safety
wray
said
it
is
a
crisis
in
la
and
i
dont
think
people
realize
the
magnitude
of
it
said
john
kump
an
outreach
program
manager
at
the
charity
people
assisting
the
homeless
path
it
is
across
the
street
from
central

it
is
actively
transforming
how
we
build
businesses
how
we
work
and
how
we
create
economies
it
is
a
decisive
step
and
it
will
not
be
the
last
he
added
in
a
later
conference
call
it
is
a
devastating
tragedy
and
i
can
not
pretend
to
imagine
what
this
family
is
going
through
at
this
time
it
is
a
difficult
and
unwelcome
choice
but
it
is
better
than
remaining
stuck
at
this
frustrating
crossroads
‚úit
is
a
few
devices
compared
to
the
thousands
of
ieds
used
by
daesh‚
he
concluded
using
the
arabic
acronym
for
isis
adding
that
he
hoped
other
countries
would
follow
suit
in
offering
equipment
and
more
importantly
expertise
it
is
a
given
that
politics
can
make
changes
to
an
educational
system
which
is
difficult
or
challenging
it
is
a
landmark
one
that
will
have
far
reaching
ramifications
for
users
of
social

in
zimbabwe
it
is
alleged
he
was
out

his

it
is
an
emotion
that
has
intentional
and
cognitive
content
it
is
an
important
decision
he
said
it
is
an
issue
that
affects
everyone
including
big
companies
like
ours
it
is
an
unbearable
thought
‚úit
is
a
purely
personal
relationship
with
his
listeners
it
is
a
question
that
most
lenders
prefer
to
avoid
because
invariably
it
leads
to
another
question
what
happens
to
the

at
the

of

period
it
is
a
ravaging
health

well
as

‚úit
is
a
scene
from
our
lives‚
nippak
says
it
is
as
though
the
germans
are
standing
up
and
saying
we
are
not
who
you
have
long
thought
we
were
it
is
a
symbolic
and
powerful
reminder
that
together
we
have
the
power
to
change
things
it
is
a
tantalizing
question
facing
the
future
of
the
american
west
what
would
happen
if
the
colorado
river
dried
up
it
is
beautiful
almost
heartbreakingly
so
but
thats
an
idealized
portrayal
and
such
a
superficial
description
of
what
nature
is
like
here
it
is
before
a
house
of
delegates
committee
right
now
it
is
believed
she
was
bleeding
heavily
from
an
arm
injury
caused
in
the
accident
and
was
taken
to
a
london
hospital
by
air
ambulance
it
is
believed
there
had
been
a
dispute
between
the
pair
over
money
following
the
sale
of
another
margate
property
it
is
both
psychologically
and
physically
damaging

louise
hartley
psychologist
at
the
university
of
york
canada
who
focuses
on
the
impact
of
depression
in
the
workplace
it
is
clear
from
the
cheery
inspired
proud
messages
i
have
been
getting
these
newly
activated
people
are
very
happy
and
motivated
it
is
clear
now
there
has
not
been
a
knockout
and
a
complete
demolition
of
houthi
firepower
it
is
currently
topping
opinion
polls
in
the
run
up
to
local
regional
and
national
elections
this
year
it
is
day
two
of
the
massive
rally
of
aquinox
pharmaceuticals
inc
aqxp
and
the
stock
is
continuing
to
push
higher
it
is
delicious
added
to
soups
and
stews
it
is
delusional
to
expect
a
country
with
a
population
of
million
to
stop
regulate
and
resolve
what
much
bigger
member
states
have
failed
to
do
it
is
democracy
at
its
finest
‚úit
is
essential
that
we
act
urgently
and
collectively‚
it
is
essential
to
act
quickly
as
the
longer
a
pet
goes
without
treatment
the
greater
the
risk
it
is
expected
to
move
north
at
kmh
and
head
to
southern
japan
by
tuesday
the
weather
bureau
said
it
is
expected
to
raise
major
new
government
revenues
and
could
provide
israel
with
strategic
leverage
in
the
region
if
it
becomes
a
gas
exporter
it
is
formally
imposed
by
the
parliament
upon
a
proposal
from
the
government
it
is
for
over
years
that
government
has
steadfastly
ignored
this
it
is
further
alleged
that
jah
cure
was
not
able
to
pay
a
fee
of
us
j
to
the
court
and
agreed
to
pay
the
remainder
by

evening
it
is
given
to
someone
who
goes
above
and
beyond
in
their
service
to
the
museum
in
tribute
to
mr
cresswell
it
is
going
to
be
a
celebration
on
our
part
said
gustavo
machin
deputy
director
for
us
affairs
at
cubas
foreign
ministry
it
is
going
to
be
a
frank
and
forwardlooking
summit
which
may
set
the
agenda
between
the
two
countries
for
many
years
to
come
it
is
heartbreaking
every
day
is
a
different
look
it
is
important
that
groening
stands
trial
but
the
survivors
had
hoped
to
see
prosecution
much
earlier
heubner
added
it
is
important
that
the
community
know
that
willamette
valley
christian
school
was
aware
of
the
ongoing
investigation
into
mr
bass
it
is
important
to
note
that
gallup
also
discovered
that
a
growing
percentage
of
nonwhites
have
lost
considerable
confidence
in
the
ability
of
police
officers
to
protect
them
it
is
important
to
note
that
while
a
state
may
export
hundreds
of
millions
or
even
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
a
particular
product
it
may
not
actually
be
producing
very
much
of
that
product
within
the
state
it
is
important
to
prevent
similar
behaviour
by
other
companies
in
future
it
is
impossible
at
this
point
to
know
exactly
when
and
where
the
polar
vortex
anomaly
will
occur
though
there
will
be
some
clues
to
watch
for
once
winter
arrives
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
coming
in
contact
with
the
germy
places
on
airplanes
and
in
airports
but
zautcke
says
thats
no
reason
to
stop
traveling
it
is
in
a
very
real
way
much
more
important
than
the
physical
office
space
that
my
weak
and
fallible
body
actually
inhabits
for
more
hours
of
the
day
than
i
care
to
admit
here
it
is
in
everyones
best
interests
to
have
separate
lanes
it
is
in
staying
with
the
pain
of
unexplainable
circumstances
and
asking
the
questions
that
seem
to
have
no
answers
that
we
often
arrive
at
the
best
possible
response
it
is
intended
to
be
a
place
where
the
visitor
can
touch
the
history
the
tradition
of
the
boston
marathon
and
then
get
out
and
do
something
go
for
a
run
themselves
it
is
known
to
draw
a
young
audience
and
about
half
of
the
users
of
the
englishlanguage
boards
for
sharing
text
pictures
or
video
are
in
the
us
it
is
likely
that
for
as
long
as
austerity
remains
on
the
ballot
of
each
major
party
as
it
probably
will
in
nationalism
will
thrive
and
the
snp
will
grow
from
strength
to
strength
it
is
likely
that
the
plane
broke
up
on
impact
after
falling
out
of
the
sky
vertically
at
an
extremely
high
speed
investigators
have
said
‚úit
is
like
that
in
every
match
it
is
loaded
wpolitical
correct
issues
it
is
more
common
in
subsaharan
africa
and
affects
an
estimated
one
tanzanian
in
it
is
much
easier
for
groups
to
come
together
virtually
to
solve
a
problem
it
is
much
more
physical
and
there
are
so
many
battles
on
the
pitch
it
is
near
marea
the
main
rebel
stronghold
in
aleppo
that
has
been
under
fierce
is
attack
for
months
and
is
now
completely
encircled
by
the
jihadists
it
is
no
coincidence
that
russia
has
steadily
risen
in
the
doing
business
index
issued
by
the
world
bank
ranking
out
of
countries
this
year
up
from
in
it
is
no
good
building
it
five
years
later‚
it
is
no
surprise
that
the
french
are
more
likely
to
be
worried
about
these
foreign
fighters
it
is
not
accurate
to
say
that
someone
who
takes
their
own
life
does
so
for
a
rational
reason
it
is
not
at
all
about
that
it
is
not
clear
how
seriously
strausskahn‚s
most
recent
recommendations
have
been
taken
in
policymaking
circles
since
he
stepped
down
amid
a
string
of
sexual
scandals
it
is
not
clear
how
the
deductions
would
affect
federal
tax
withholding
or
healthinsurance
payments
it
is
not
clear
who
committed
such
atrocities
said
the
un
mission
which
emphasized
that
the
government
and
all
parties
must
ensure
that
all
civilians
are
protected
and
that
combatants
are
controlled
so
they
dont
target
civilians
it
is
noteworthy
that
those
mps
who
spearheaded
and
supported
restrictions
on
abortion
in
the
last
parliament
while
claiming
to
be
interested
in
protecting
women
also
showed
zero
interest
in
measures
that
genuinely
would
help
pregnant
women
it
is

the

that

in

it

one
of

steffen
seibert
spokesman
for
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
on
wednesday
it
is
our
first
experience
of
that
darkness
it
is
our
hope
that
the
essay
will
gnaw
on
the
consciences
of
readers
who
may
recall
an
instance
of
their
own
repugnant
behavior
they
wrote
it
is
our
hope
that
through
this
action
true
change
will
come
not
only
in
ferguson
but
around
the
country
they
said
in
a
statement
it
is
palpably
mischievous
to
insinuate
that
the
party
vice
president
is
for
participation
in
the
forthcoming
byelections
in
violation
of
a
congress
resolution
of
a
party
where
she
is
vice
president
it
is
plainly
illegal
it
is
pretty
cool
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
sentence
as
those
guys
he
said
it
is
pretty
exciting
just
to
see
that
we
can
have
this
festival
here
in
spokane
and
bring
so
much
attention
to
the
city
but
overall
its
been
really
good
for
business
it
is
probably
news
to
you
then
that
beta
cassettes
are
still
a
thing
you
can
buy
it
is
putting
those
words
in
an
easy
context
it
is
radical
islamic
terrorism
it
is
really
hard
for
me
to
put
into
words
how
it
felt
talking
with
her
it
is
recommended
to
check
schedulit
daily
but
not
mandatory
it
is
so
easy
to
stay
busy
in
our
taskoriented
pluggedin
highlymedicated
world
and
forget
to
checkin
with
ourselves
and
question
our
habitual
thoughts
and
behaviors
it
is
strange
to
be
face
to
face
with
an
animal
that
can
potentially
kill
you
‚úit
is
such
a
devastating
illness
and
the
journey
is
so
lonely
and
you
never
really
come
back
to
the
person
you
were‚
it
is
surprising
that
at
this
point
the
organizing
committee
which
emerged
from
the
entitys
constituent
congress
despite
its
undeniable
technological
capabilities
doesnt
have
its
own
digital
site
it
is
the
deposition
of
an
illusory
government
that
drove
the
country
into
the
worst
crisis
in
years
it
is
the
first
such
claim
in
europe
and
it
could
set
an
important
legal
precedent
at
a
time
when
the
world‚s
first
climate
change
refugees
are
just
beginning
to
emerge
it
is
the
first
time
that
either
nation
has
agreed
to
accept
former
guantanamo
prisoners
for
resettlement
it
is
the
kind
of
hate
that
when
left
unchecked
can
lead
to
rogue
police
officers
believing
they
can
get
away
with
abusing
and
killing
black
citizens
it
is
the
major
party
in
the
current
ruling
coalition
as
of
may
it
is
the
very
reason
we
must
hammer
out
an
ironclad
agreement
to
ensure
iran
can
not
get
its
hands
on
a
nuclear
bomb
it
is
this
phony
overconfidence
which
machoness
generates
that
results
in
all
these
ills
of
society
it
is
this
sense
of
responsibility
and
passion
for
the
plans
which
drove
rigby
through
her
selection
process
it
is
through
observing
the
motion
of
binary
stars
that
scientists
have
identified
black
holes
that
have
masses
close
to
that
of
our
sun
it
is
time
for
a
doer
he
said
it
is
time
for
exim
to
stop
lagging
and
state
unequivocally
that
it
will
reject
any
proposal
to
use
our
tax
dollars
to
support
adanis
failing
carmichael
mine
it
is
time
for
the
world
to
free
itself
from
the
strictures
of
doha
it
is
time
to
take
a
step
back
it
is
time
to
talk
about
what
the
buildings
that
bear
their
names
say
about
the
students
faculty
and
administrators
working
within
them
it
is
to
announce
yourself
against
the
discoveries
of
science
or
so
frightened
of
those
who
are
that
you
can
be
swayed
from
answering
honestly
it
is
tradition
to
raise
a
maypole
for
midsummer
the
longest
day
of
the
year
it
is
unacceptable
and
must
not
be
swept
from
view
or
used
as
a
scapegoat
for
the
political
failings
of
the
ruling
class
it
is
unclear
what
will
happen
when
calgary

monday
it
is

that
kim

recently
had
her

its

its

big
decision
and
i
think
weve
decided
it‚s
a
bolder
strategy

it
may
seem
at
first

it
sets
the

apart

for

not

the

i
surely
appreciate

now
its
time
to
use
that
experience
elsewhere
its
been
a
great

of
selftransformation
its
been
a
longheld
theory
that
those

perform
better
its
been
a

thats
what
led

im
still
in

with
the
trauma
she
said
through
an
interpreter
its
been
very
good
for
me
its
behavior
threatens
to
set
a
new
precedent
whereby
larger

are
free
to
intimidate

that
provokes

its

model
epitomized
by

based
on

anthony

its
called
the

tmt
for
short
because
the

probably
the

its

definitely
a

she

its
one
you
just
have
to
take
a
leap
on

its
difficult
because
the

forced

to
understand
that

its
difficult
for

like

transport
to
cope
its
difficult
to
definitely
say
that
no
prominent
current
heads

its
difficult
to
get
a
sense
of
how
a

works
when
youre
being

through

in

its
easier

cheaper

put
the

on
something
taking
up
of
the

versus
putting
it
on
something
that
takes
up

the

are

handy

was
more

a

‚
the

lucy
milne
told
the
bbc
it
seems
like
a
good
idea
to
soothe
your
liver
with
a
loaf
of
bread
but
once
youre
thoroughly
stuffed
your
body
is
back
under
attack
it
seems
like
a
very
simple
step
that
wouldnt
require
a

of

even
if

dry
theyre
still
managing
to
inspire

to
spend
their
own
money
and
act
on
the

it
seems
like
in
the
sands
of
the
time
this
is
one
of
those
old
ways
of
doing
things
‚úit
seems
odd
that
justice
thomas

that
if

the

should
be
just
as
worried

still
taking
its

three

on

seems
we
are
also
supposed
to
be
relieved
by
the
fact
that
hicks
who
carried
a
gun
to
earlier
confrontations
with
his

was
not
a

it
seems
with

when

the

is
not

the

the

it

lets
let

it
do
make

you

it
should
however
sensitize

to

of

this
includes

she
said
its
important
not
to
get
carried
away
and
hijack
the
conversation
its
important
that
prison

be
conducted
fairly
he
said
because
inmates
have
little
autonomy
behind

and
are
subject
to
someone
elses

‚úit‚s
important
to

there

not

in
that

that

to
oscillate
between

not
that

amazing
to
see
how

really
not

one
of

most
prominent

its
something
that

good

he

at

that

no

something
that
we
felt

privileged
to
be
a

said
its
something
that
were
going
to
keep
pushing
for
because
theres
that
element
of
opening
everybodys
eyes
to
the
issue
he
said
its
something
which
ive
seen
as
a
reality
it‚s
so
obvious
that
when
it
comes
to
national
finances
the
‚úbankrupt
greeks‚ú
are
simply
not
as
disciplined
as
the
germans
its
sort
of
just
been
a
part
of
our
lives
so
when
its
gone
it
will
obviously
be
missed
its
so
tough
to
see
kids
that
cant
afford
to
fix
a

that
they

theyre

me
its

its
the
hard

that
jesus
taught
us
over

its
the
highest
level
since
the

much
of
it
is
in

companies
its
their

change

they
are
worried
about
their

he
told

adding
that

activity
had
historically
gone
handinhand
with

its
the

its
the
only
moment
when
the

seems
to
wander
off
the

it‚s
the
perfect
prompt
to
perk
up
your
head
and
look
around
and
realize
the

isn‚t
a
muddy
frozen
ice
planet
anymore
its
the

worries

said
scott
brown
chief

james
its
the

pretending

the

without
fraying

just
not

its

its
thirtyone

it‚s
this
apparent
contradiction
over

both
acknowledging
her
celebrity
and
denying
it
that
i
ask
maloney
about
when
we
speak
a
couple
of
weeks
after
our
first
conversation
it
still
suffers
from
light
leaks
but
in
many
cases
this
just
adds
to
the
character
of
the

its
time
for
muslims
to
really
stand
up
and
really
fight
these

and
defeat
them
through

too

this

that
freedom
of

in

through
which
trillion

shipborne
trade
passes
every

was
guaranteed
its
to
recognise
that
the
real
power
and
communicating
about
your
company
comes
from
the
people
who
use
your
company
products
or
services
its
tough
because
if
you
hit
people
over
the
head
with
it
it
becomes
intrusive
and
there
are
people
who
dont
want
or
care
about
it
its
tough
being
a
premier
athlete
as
he
is
its
tough
but
there
are
no
excuses
he
said
its
tough
to
simulate
the

i
worked

be

‚úit‚s

she
said
its
true
that
no

thanos

the

in
an

with
dw
it
successfully
got
those
rules
tossed
out
nearly
one

many

assumed
this
meant
isps
would
be
free
to
charge
companies
more
money
to
ensure
the
speedy
delivery
of
their

it
suggested

were
moving
to
formal

instead
creating
more

than
student

its
unclear
exactly
how
remediation
of
the
site
would
be
done
and
who
would
pay
for
it
the

ownership
group
is
not
offering
to

any
of
that
tab
as

whether

unclear
whether
the
higher

result
in

its
unknown
who
took
this
picture
because
all

are
anonymous
it‚s
up
to
a
psychotherapist
to
use
regression
techniques
to
discover
the
truth
but
his
pendulum
reveals
much
more
than
anyone
would
ever
want
to

its
up

to
take

whether

conklin
said
it
sure
doesnt
give
me
confidence
‚úit‚s
usually
a
couple
degrees
of

there
‚
that‚s

about

the

but
this

the

rather
more

up
from

in
late
making
it
the
fourthhighestvalued
venturebacked
private

company
in
the
world
its
very
different
its
very
difficult
to
describe
but
it
is
the
sense
almost
that
the
emperor
has
no
clothes
its
very
disheartening
to
see
generation
after
generation
go
through
this
hegwood
said
its
very
likely
that
many
more
people
were
actually
infected
with
the

and
simply
did
not
exhibit
symptoms
last
year
according
to

its
very
premature
to
speculate
on
that

its
all
about

that
this

will
take
place
next

for

third

it
was
a
great
performance
and
sadly
it‚s
going

off

books
it
was
a
hard
decision
but
it
was
also
the
best
decision
i
had
ever
made
mrs

said
it
was
a
horrible

said

while

after

four
decades
later

have
finished

it
was
a
long
well
thought
out
decision
our

made
it
was

a

for
wind
power
as
the

is
to

the

that
fleming
created
he
said
in
an

with
the
bbc
in
may
it
was
a
massive
explosion
really
something
it
was
a
message
heard
across
the
nation
in
more
protests
for
other
black
americans
who
died
by
police
hands
it
was
an
accident
and
poor
judgment
said
tom
brandt
a
spokesman
for
jenkins
it
was
an
amazing
location
and
the
canadian
museum
for
human

was
supposed
to

it

vaidhyanathan
said
‚úit
was
a
situation
where
i
hadn‚t
seen
him
all
summer
and
i
don‚t
know
if
he
got
cold
feet
because
it‚s
football
and
it‚s
new
to
him
but
he
came
out
to
the
first
game
and
saw
what
transpired
it
was
a
small
difference
but
we
got
a
slightly
bigger
refund
for
it
it
was
a

about

‚úattacked‚
a

it
was
obvious
from
its

speed
just
how
important
the
new

in
bavaria
was
to
the
americans
it
was
one
of
my
first

it
was

ordered
that

within

it

they
were
blocking

and
were

dayton

archie
miller
said
of
the

it
was
pretty
heart
wrenching
it
was
probably
all
she‚d
had
in
her
purse
at
the
time‚all
she
ever
seemed
to
have
in
her
purse
it
was
probably
on
a
radio
station
and
middle
school
students
listen
to
that
crap
anyways
not
like
the
music
influenced
the
fight
it
was
question
after
question
after
question
about
the
mysteries
of
management
and
the
business
side
it
was
really
loud
it
was
really
really
intense
it
was
she
who
chose
the
name
maryam
the
name
of
her
dead
daughter
it
was
so
bright
it
was
so
sweet
it
was
standing
room
only
inside
with
entertainment
that
included
a
wide
variety
of
singers
musicians
and
dancers
it
was
surprising
and
it
was
horrible
for
me
it
was
tabled
for
one
week
to
examine
some
of
the
wording
in
the
petition
it
was
taken
two
years
ago
by
our
friend
it
was
that
backtoback
conversation
with
her
that
i
felt
was
going
so
smoothly
that
i
felt
comfortable
enough
to
lean
over
and
get
her
it
was
the
first
game
brees
has
missed
because
of
injury
since
joining
the
saints
in
it
was
the
first
of
two
similar
incidents
said
tarshis
who
is
now
a
journalist
and
publicist
it
was
the
first
time
i
felt
the
inkling
that
maybe
i
didnt
belong
it
was
the
first
time
republicans
controlled
both
chambers
in
more
than
years
and
it
was
fueled
largely
by
the
kochallied
pope
foundation
it
was
the
kings‚
final
season
opener
at
sleep
train
arena
before
moving
to
their
new
downtown
home
next

it
was
the
meal
the
red
arches
of
salisbury
house
restaurants
have
become
an
iconic
symbol
in
winnipeg
since
they
began
serving
their
nips
in
it
was
the
mobile
division‚s
fifth
consecutive
quarter
of
decline
in
contrast
to
apple‚s
recordbreaking
million
iphone
sales
in
the
three
months
to
dec
last
year
on
the
back
of
the
success
of
its
bigscreen
iphone
and
plus
it
was
the
one
chance
in
his
illustrious
career
to
compete
in
front
of
a
canadian
crowd
and
it
was
where
he
made
some
of
his
fondest
sports
memories
‚
the
type
canadas
top
athletes
will
be
compiling
at
the
pan
american

‚úit
was
the
one
we
just
got
tired
of
the
most

frank
spadafora
of

do
it
was
the
second
such
operation
in
a
matter
of
days
after
migrants
were
rescued
on
thursday
in
the
same
area
under
similar
circumstances
it
was
the
third
consecutive
doubledigit
loss
for
the
pelicans
who
were
playing
their
home
opener
at
the
smoothie
king
arena
it
was
the
third
such
incident
in
recent
weeks
it
was
the
winner
of
the
olivier
award
for
best
new
play
it
was
translated
into
english
and
edited
for
a
global
audience
it
was
unclear
whether
the
cps
documents
were
referring
to
the
boy
charged
with
killing
his
mother
or
another
child
it
was
unclear
whether
the
two
men
who
were
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
actually
participated
in
the
attack
it
was
unclear
who
was
trying
to
disrupt
the
voting
though
people
in
the
crowd
blamed
martelly
supporters
it
was
very
clear
from
charley
and
me
that
we
wanted
to
see
the
putt
taken
added
pettersen
a
veteran
of
eight
solheim
cup
campaigns
it
was
very
gradual
appropriately
so
probably
for
the
country
but
i
discussed
that
issue
with
him
several
times
and
he
was
a
strong
believer
it
was
very
hard
in
macedonia
she
said
it
was
very
inspiring
it
was
very
monotonous
at
times
it
was
very
obvious
the

in

it

very
wild

for

told

water
agriculture

it

also
fund
the
creation
of
a
nonprofit
organization
to
develop
a
set
of
voluntary
standards
for
isaos
it
would
also
include
some
of
the
same
features
as
the
current
beats
service
such
as
cloud
streaming
curated
song
playlists
and
a
year
price
tag
it
would
also
prohibit
the
federal
government
from
discriminating
against
individuals
and
organizations
because
of
their
beliefs
about
marriage
it
would
be
like
sleep
without
dreams
it
would
be
one
thing
if
the
hawks
simply
led
the
league
in
rushing
yards
but
the
fact
that
they
led
in
yards
per
carry
suggests
that
opponents
were
perpetually
perplexed
‚úit
would
be
wrong
now
years
after
your

subsequent

send
you

health
back

said
it
would
depend
wholly
on
whether
a

wants

about

take
the

it
and
whether
theres

that

it

‚úit

it

by
the
end

if
congress
fails
to
authorize
the

include

infrared

an
accompanying

that
would
let
you
store
as
many
remotes
as
you
want
in
order
to
control
everything
in

it
would
increase

have

use
half

make

twice
as

begrudgingly
saying
i
wish
it
to
be

that
i
was
the
last
man
of
my

to
surrender
my

it
would
tell

grow

provide
new

into
the
strange

that
takes

todorov
says
i
was
years
old
fat
and
confident
enough
to
tell
the
adult
in
charge
of
this
highropes
challenge
forced
upon
me
by
an
evil
camp
director
im
not
going
to
climb
that
i
was
able
to
save
up
enough
money
to
build
a
second
burger
king
i
was
able
to
understand
but
i
couldnt
agree
i
was
acting
instinctively
‚úi
was
a
private
gynecologist
in
a
small
town
in
maharashtra
in
india
for
more
than
years‚
he
told
reuters
health
i
was
critical
of
sanchez
when
they
bought
him
from
barcelona
in
the
summer
and
said
he
was
inconsistent
i
was
especially
intrigued
by
the
size
of
the
inch

inch
posts
mark
assured
were
necessary
and
commented
that
this
outhouse
was
not
for
the
use
of
elephants
i
was
going
in
debt
borrowing
just
to
keep
going
but
now
we
are
running
to
the
limit
‚úi
was
going
through
some
things‚
johnson
said
matter
of
factly
i
was
happy
because
i
never
seen
it
that
high
up
from
a
plane
she
recalls
i
was
happy
with
the
way
we
fought
back
but
it
just
came
down
to
it
that
we
couldnt
get
stops
on
the
defensive
end
meyers
said
i
was
hoping
that
i
was
going
to
go
home
that
day
odom
recalling
his
trial
in
washington
dc
said
in
an
interview
i
was
in
the
senate
at
the
same
time
clinton
countered
after
sanders
explained
his
position
i
was
just
a
chatterbox
and
i
confided
in
my
makeup
artist
dude
im
on
fucking
coke
right
now
i
was
just
blown
away
by
the
scale
of
the
piece
and
the
beauty
of
the
music
he
says
and
really
also
the
intellectual
scale
because
it
really
asked
sort
of
the
two
most
important
questions
that
art
asks
which
is
how
do
we
end
and
how
do
we
begin
i
was
just
hoping
his
batteries
would
last
and
they
did
he
added
i
was
just
kind
of
hanging
out
with
my
mom
and
we
thought
it
would
be
a
cool
thing
to
do
she
said
i
was
just
like
okay
now
is
my
time
to
have
this
interview
on
my
own
terms
i
was
just
losing
matches
and
didnt
know
why
i
was
legitimately
terrified
said
laychuk
i
was
like
get
in
the
game
again
i
was
looking
at
images
i
had
shot
with
my
doeverything
dslr
and
it
got
me
thinking
back
to
the
early
days
of
photography
he
says
i
was
looking
for
one
spot
on
the
pitch
and
i
didnt
get
it
i
was
lying
in
bed
for
a
while
on
crutches
podladtchikov
said
i
was
mortified
by
this
horrified
i
was
moved
by
the
testimony
of
edna
king
who
shared
with
me
the
joy
of
her
daughter
mary
evelyn
i
was
no
fan
of
the
ugly
blank
cards
that
populated
ios
s
app
switcher
and
apple
clearly
wasnt
either
as
theyve
been
fixed
even
if
it
sometimes
takes
a
second
for
them
to
update
i
wasnt
assured
in
any
way
that
this
was
fixable
in
a
sense
that
they
are
able
to
change
these
vehicles
so
that
they
still
have
high
performance
meet
the
emission
controls
and
meet
the
milespergallon
standards
i
wasnt
just
committing
to
emily
i
was
committing
to
a
different
life
a
life
rooted
in
connection
and
partnership
i
wasnt
trying
to
hurt
him
i
was
just
trying
to
stop
him
from
dunking
the
ball
i
was
out
to
lunch
last
year
said
larson
who
was
admittedly
nervous
about
making
mistakes
before
his
rolex
debut
and
then
made
several
in
his
first
stint
i
was
pretty
happy
with
the
way
we
played‚
i
was
riffling
them
onehanded
like
a
deck
of
cards
when
a
woman
appeared
next
to
me
and
offered
a
comforting
pat
on
my
shoulder
i
was
rudely
shocked
when
the
first
teargas
canister
was
lobbed
into
the
midst
of
a
group
of
them
i
was
some
miles
away
when
i
heard
the
fishermen
calling
for
help
when
a
chinese
ship
used
water
cannon
on
them
michael
lanog
from
the
coastal
village
of
masinloc
told
reuters
i
was
so
terrified
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
i
did
that
quite
easily‚
i
was
taught
the
only
four
chords
i
know
by
a
friend
i
was
teased
for
having
short
nappy
hair
which
really
weighed
on
my
selfesteem
i
was
terrified
i
would
pick
the
wrong
classes
and
end
up
wasting
my
time
i
was
the
best
new
artist
this
year
i
was
there
on
june
and
there
was
definitely
construction
in
that
area
i
was
the
team
leader
and
i
had
the
responsibility
to
test
the
drug
myself
she
said
i
was
thinking
of
loretta
and
a
number
of
other
family
members
that
ive
gotten
to
know
in
the
past
two
years
now
because
of
what
happened
to
loretta
i
was
tipped
off
by
james
wood‚s
review
and
i
read
‚úmy
brilliant
friend‚
which
was
an
utter
thrill
i
was
trying
to
get
it
out

my
pocket
he
said
i
was
trying
to
put
in

to
get
out
and
it
died

the
water
started
rising
immediately
he
told
the
weather
channel
i
was
very
impressed
by
such
a
big
car
i
was
very
upset
when
a
guy
near
me
started
to
record
video
of
you
making
fun
of
your
style
i
was
walking
in
the
wrong
direction
down
wembley
way
i
was
wearing
a
white
tshirt
that
wasnt
mine
and
he
was
in
a
white
robe
i
was
with
three
friends
a
guy
and
two
girls
having
dinner
at
a
sicilian
restaurant
we
were
talking
about
work
and
holiday
plans

the
plaintiffs
from
the
michigan

i
am
calling
max
i
went
to
games
last
year
and

with
my
friend
mandee
castle
i
will
be
asking
for
help
from
the
outside
an
organization
may
come
into
our
community
where
they
can
rescue
some
pets
or
do
with
them
as
they
will
need
to
do
she
said
i
will
be
disappointed
if
i
have
to
miss
this
season
but
i
want
to
look
at
all
the
options
including
getting
a
second
opinion
before
i
make
a
final
decision
i
will
be
grateful
if
you
continue
this
in
the
future
i
will
have
work
for
a
long
time
to
come
konstantin

live
my
life
and
i
will
not
allow

to
prevent
me
from
living
life
to
the

i
will
make
a
decision
very
very
shortly
he
told
cnns
jeff
zeleny
at
his
first
event
of
the
day
i
will
most
people
will
i
will
never
buy
gm
again
i
will
never
forget
the
words
of
my
grandmother
as
i
was
leaving
home
to
move
to
new
york
city
that
ring
in
my
ears
today
be
nice
to
people
i
will
not
put
any
wagers
down
as
to
her
guilt
or
innocence
i
will
not
sign
a
document
that
puts
one
dollar
of
taxpayers
money
on
the
line
for
one
penny
of
overruns
on
the
olympics
he
said
i
will
not
sit
back
and
let
these
criminals
and
cyber
terrorists
attack
our
businesses
intrude
into
our
private
lives
and
destroy
trust
in
our
digital
economy
and
society
he
said
i
will
not
vote
this
time
said
mikael
a
taxi
driver
who
declined
to
give
his
last
name
for
fear
of
government
reprisals
adding
that
the
eprdf
did
not
play
a
fair
game
i
will
say
this
i
was
confused
and
i
was
sitting
there
patlan
said
i
will
simply
say
that
i
am
in
great
pain
have
experienced
a
significant
injury
and
that
the
injury
was
caused
by
the
police‚
i
will
smile
for
edison
i
will
suggest
going
back
on
this
because
its
an
element
of
complexity
he
added
i
will
try
not
to
go
too
much
into
the
dinnr
specifics
i
wish
i
could
slap
you
right
now
i
wish
i
could
turn
back
the
hands
of
time
to
try
to
make
a
difference
to
try
to
change
things
but
i
cant
i
wish
i
wrote
the
knaan
song
waving
flag
‚úi
wish
that
they
would
have
this
kind
of
festival
every
day‚
mr
gonzales
said
i
wish
them
godspeed
in
cleaning
it
up
and
containing
it
i
wish
we
could
have
won
it
here
david
wright
said
but
clayton
kershaw
was
just
a
beast
tonight
i
witnessed
the
porto
fans
during
the
champions
league
final
against
monaco
said
neuer
i
woke
up
this
morning
and
said
a
prayer
thanking
god
to
be
in
this
situation
because
a
year
ago
today
i
was
a
little
lost
in
the
league
i
woke
up
this
morning
and
spoke
to
more
family
and
friends
cried
a
little
bit
he
said
i
wonder
how
many
lives
just
like
my
mothers
the
us
government
is
needlessly
and
cruelly
damaging
today
for
its
illadvised
family
detention
program
i
would
also
know
that
there‚s
been
so
much
and
i
would
like
to
thank
joi
bourne
of
st
francis
and
monseigneur
craig
harrison
who
allowed
that
because
she
provided
us
some
times
and
times
to
get
some
questions
out
i
would
be
investing
very
heavily
in
data
integration
technology
especially
in
the
integration
with
upstream
systems
‚úi
would
be
lying
if
i
say
i
feel
that
i
am
ready
to
win‚
i
would
consider
upgrading
to
a
more
powerful
home
battery
if
they
could
figure
out
a
way
to
get
me
totally
off
the
grid
i
would
guess
the
same
thought
applies
to
a
will
i
would
hear
little
snippets
of
conversation
around
it
and
id
be
like
just
so
you
know
id
love
to
be
a
part
of
this
i
would
just
say
that
i
am
listening
extremely
carefully
i
would
like
to
help
anyone
in
general
but
im
focusing
on
the
youth
because
when
you
are
young
you
dont
know
where
to
turn
i
would
like
to
warn
those
who
would
once
again
try
to
organise
some
sort
of
provocations
against
our
servicemen
putin
said
i
would
like
to
widen
the
sphere
of
history
as
walt
whitman
did
that
of
poetry
i
would
not
like
to
have
found
out
from
the
news
added
parent
natalie
naranjo
i
would
not
want
those
victims
to
now
feel
that
if
they
do
come
forward
and
they
make
those
reports
that
their
lives
will
then
be
subjected
to
the
type
of
scrutiny
and
type
of
exposure
that
we
have
seen
in
the
recent
weeks
and
months
he
said
i
would
not
want
to
go
through
an
earthquake
again
but
it
sure
was
a
great
night
to
work
in
radio
and
see
how
it
can
make
a
difference
in
peoples
lives

wouldn‚t
be
involved‚

i
wouldn‚t
rule
it
out
he
said
when
asked
if
he
would
vote
for
another
coalition
i
wouldnt
say
she
is
similar
to
jodie
taylor
but
i
think
jodie
offers
more
down
the
channels
whereas
tash
tends
to
hold
the
ball
up
more

wouldnt
want
to
hang
out

technically
sophisticated

the

and
by

not

say
that

anything
crazy
like
that

it

its
up

to
hear

me
when
my
lovely

emily

posted
a

on

why
you
shouldnt
netflix
and
chill
now
just
the

then
that
intimate

are
often
managed
like
a
computer

no
wonder
the
plp
chairman
and
the
government
are
so
defensive
personal
and
belligerent
over
its
vat
policy
and
secretive
over
the
accounting
of
exactly
where
these
tax
dollars
are
being
spent
now
plan
is
to
pay
a
taxi
euros
to
drive
to
vienna
now
seems
to
be
the
right
moment
for
the
leaders
who
are
directly
concerned
here
to
seek
a
fresh
viable
solution
relying
on
currently
accepted
principles
of
contemporary
behavioral
economics
now
step
back
and
admire
how
you
have
successfully
decluttered
now
that
hes
clean
and
trying
to
get
back
on
his
feet
he
decided
to
head
to
the
advance
poll
now
that
is
not
to
say
that
i
dont
sympathize
with
waiters
and
waitresses
for
how
little
they
are
paid
now
that
mobiles
are
the
dominant
form
of
communication
were
just
asking
that
these
free
calls
be
extended
to
mobile
now
that
picture
has
changed
and
china
has
become
our
key
market
for
sure
now
thats
a
question
of
strength
but
its
also
a
question
of
judgment
now
that
sir
howards
commission
has
made
its
recommendation
the
government
must
commit
to
the
decision
now
and
get
diggers
in
the
ground
at
heathrow
swiftly
by
now
that
state
is
rethinking
the
rules
that
allow
parents
to
optout
of
having
their
children
vaccinated
now
that
the
early
phase
of
the
competition
will
soon
wind
down
a
freeforall
primarily
revolving
around
televised
debates
trump
will
have
to
prove
his
chops
if
he
is
to
win
in
iowa
new
hampshire
and
the
primaries
that
follow
now
that

to

has
pleaded

visa
offences
now
the

is
worried
some

wont
want
to
pay
the

with
no
guarantee
theyll
open
now
the
bush
administrations
approach
was
were
not
going
to
allow
you
to
become
a
nuclear
state
but
we
are
neither
going
to
go
to
war
against
you
nor
structure
a
diplomatic
alternative
for
you
now
the

waits
to
see
if
they
get

support
at

city

now
the
focus
is
shifting

of

this
years
oscars
largely
went

artistic

now
the
once
secretive
realm
acts
without
restraint
now
the

can
please
the
base
that
elected
him
to
two
terms
while
plausibly
denying
that
he
does
not
oppose
the
project
just
attempts
to
leapfrog
his
administrations
review
of
the
project
now
theres
a
concept
for
a
great
tv
show
now
there‚s
a
good
chance
he
never
plays
another
game
in
the
american
hockey
league
now
there
seems
to
be
a
good
medical
reason
to
do
so
now
the
saying
became
an
educational
vehicle
in
the
black
community
to
expose
the
daily
crisis
that
would
now
be
revealed
by
video
footage
taken
by
courageous
witnesses
now
the
side
opposite
likes
to
say
that
they
have
rescued
this
country
from
fiscal
mismanagement
in
but
i
ask
the
bahamian
people
are
they
better
off
today
than
they
were
in
now
the
team
is
finalised
we
can
all
have
full
focus
for
the
week
in
germany
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
the
players
together
at
st
leonrot
now
the
united
states
unequivocally
provides
a
security
backstop
for
israel
and
the
gulf
states
against
iran
now
the
websites
administrators
have
started
taking
action
deleting
five
subreddits
which
break
the
rules
based
on
their
harassment
of
individuals
now
they
needed
to
raise
money
to
renovate
the
space
now
theyre
scared
they
wont
have
benefits
he
added
now
they
risk
losing
credibility
on
a
typical
cornerstone
issue
for
their
party
‚
national
security
‚
by
making
avoidance
of
a
dhs
shutdown
the
first
critical
test
of
their
new
majority
in
the

now
think
of
all

dramatically
as

gave

once
everyone

that
an

is

the
next

is
to
draft

he
got
up

he
just
loosened

was

once

once

i
could
see
i
didnt
feel
too
bad
and
could
give
it
a
go
once
notified
of
the
allegations
the

immediately
retained
outside

to
conduct
an
independent
internal
investigation
which
in
part
is
still
ongoing
once
petersons
playing
status
is
clarified
theres
still
the
glaring
matter
of
his
disinterest
in
continuing
his
career
in
minnesota
once
primarily
focused
on
drawing
its
brand
of
the
faithful
to
a
socalled
caliphate
in
the
middle
east
the
islamic
state

has
increasingly
urged
its

to
conduct

on

once

the

will
be
under

not

discuss
the
case
once
somebody
has
that
taint
they
are
just
looked
at
differently
once
the

begins
the

will
shift

ultimately
attracted
more

than

once
there
i
had
to
figure
it
all
out
and
my
belief
that
i
could
handle
these
things
contrary
to
all
evidence
of
my
ability
to
do
so
was
half
the
battle
once
the

clear
out
the
high

off

once

we

which
brought

and
beeps
or
vibrates
when

senses
the
telltale

one
lesson
from
this
study
is
that
even
in
countries
with
very
restrictive
laws
women
are
still
seeking
abortions
one
limitation
of
the
new
study
is
that
the
researchers
didnt
ask
about
driving
while
intoxicated
specifically
for
alcohol
and
marijuana
one
local

even
has
his
own
timehonored
tradition
of

one
major

of

to
the

the

one
of
the
biggest
challenges
is
developing
a

entry

also
mid

seniorlevel
talent
one
of
the
biggest
concentration
camps
thousands
of
prisoners
from
auschwitz
and
grossrosen
had
been
transferred
there
one
of
the
biggest
deterrents
for
drugmakers
is
that
any
new
more
powerful
antibiotics
would
need
to
be
used
sparingly
because
overuse
could
give
rise
to
even
more
resistant
bacteria
he
said
one
of
the
bullets
however
went
into
a

narrowly
missed

according
to
the

document
one
of

of

of

one
of

the

perhaps
the

of
just
how
bad

was
when
dorothy

about
the
birth
of

last

perhaps
the
ring
on

that
symbolizes

deep
devotion
perhaps
the
root
cause
of
my
lack
of
success
in
gaining
press
credentials
for
most
of
this

lies
in
the
attention
i
gave
in
my
articles
last
year
to
the
role
money
plays
in

del
sole
perhaps
this
is
because
its
political
rivals
in
china
were
pursuing
authoritarian
policies
china
was
on
the
way
to
becoming
a
oneparty

impossible

there
were
some
small
sacrifices
to
her
social
life
that
came
with
living
with
her
folks
but
that
it
allowed

the
prime

attitude
to

betrays
the
worst
characteristics
of
his

patrician
and
out
of

she
said
the
proposed

between
pacific
rim
countries
did
not
address
currency
manipulation
she

she
says
the
only
missing
peacock
was
in
toronto
she
says
the
problem
wasnt
bringing
the
horses
but
the
question
was
where
to
keep
them
she
says
the
tax
incentive
seemed
like
an
unnecessary
gift
to
a
private
company
for
a
project
that
was
going
to
generate
few
if
any
jobs
and
divert
money
from
more
necessary
projects
with
greater
public
benefit
she
says
to

and
when

come
up
just
say
‚úthinking‚

at

most

will
be

so
a
couple
of
otts
closest
work
friends
huddled
with
her
in
a
private

‚úso
after
the
olympics
why
can‚t
i
continue
in

where
i
have
lived
for
years‚
she
said
so
all
these
people
yelling
and
screaming
ask
you
ask
them
what
have
you
accomplished
in
the
time
that
youve
been
in
public
office
so
although
the
constant
moving
in
my
childhood
as
an
army
brat
was
sometimes
traumatic
it
gave
me
a
larger
view
of
the
world
so
any
type
of
movement
towards
you
it
can
be
quite
threatening
so
a
really
different
class
of
risk
he
said
so
are
product
introductions
corporate
research
and
development
budgets
and
hightech
payrolls
so
are
the
jokes
likely
to
stop
so
are
they
engaged
with
you
are
they
talking
to
you
are
they
explaining
their
business
problems
to
you
so
asked
lee
does
that
sentence
about
the
presence
of
militants
not
justifying
strikes
that
endanger
innocent
civilians
stand
as
us
government
policy
so
as
strange
as
it
may
seem
within
a

a

‚úso
because

so
dont

even
further
if

so
dont
pull

so
do
you
want

so
even
if

with

you
don‚t
even
know
for

if
he
was
fucking

and
he‚d
be
a
fool
to
admit
to
you
that
he
was‚he
didn‚t
put
her
at

of
acquiring
hiv
so
even
if
muscle
is
lost
from
taking
time
away
for
many
years
a
person
can
regain
the
lost
muscle
much
more
quickly
after
an
extended
layoff
so
far
about
barrels
of
crude
oil
have
been
removed
from
the
waters
so
far
his
children
have
suggested
he
should
dress
up
as
a
minion
from
despicable
me
elsa
from
frozen
a
potato
and
a
dragon
and
spiderman
so
far
horizon
has
funded
nearly
businesses
so
far
in
only
two
doses
have
been
needed
so
far
in
they
are
allowing
points
per
game
which
is
tied
for
thirdworst
in
the
league
so
far
in
year
one
about
young
people
are
engaged
in
the
program
so
far
it
has
saved
more
than
people
‚úso
far
it‚s
been
okay‚
he
said
so
far
japanese
troops
have
been
restricted
to
japan
and
its
vicinity
and
the
changes
are
currently
being
discussed
in
parliament
so
far
just
one
company
out
of
about
six
that
operate
in
the
state
has
expressed
any
interest
so
far
more
than
residential
wells
tested
near
dukes
dumps
have
failed
to
meet
state
groundwater
standards
so
far
police
have
found
nothing
improper
about
the
detained
pigeon
so
far
so
close
so
far
that
hasn‚t
happened
so
far
the
company
has
been
mum
on
the
details
so
far
the
company
will
be
producing
cucumbers
only
of
the
production
will
be
exported
to
russia
so
far
the
fourth
quarter
numbers
have
been
pretty
tough
said
david
bakula
nielsen
entertainments
senior
vice
president
of
industry
insights
so
far
the
operation
has
focused
largely
on
the
kurdish
rebels
so
far
the
province
has
closed
two
visitor
information
centres
and
reduced
staff
at
seven
provincial
parks
so
far
this
time
around
the
great
kate
wait
does
seem
more
subdued
so
far
this
year
the
program
has
received
only
percent
of
its
funding
needs
allowing
it
to
provide
aid
to
people
dei
said
so
feeforservice
is
demonized
for
creating
incentives
to
‚údo
more‚
but
the
newer
alternatives
use
the
same
incentives
so
for
us
to
come
from
behind
and
show
some
grit
during
the
season
thats
the
mark
of
a
good
team
so
we
finally
got
to
that
point
software
used
by
many
researchers
m
health
information
systems
medicare
severity
grouper
took
each
patients
condition
into
account
so
getting
the
eyes
positioned
in
the
head
just
right
is
a
very
hard
thing
to
do
so
give
this
list
a
read
think
of
how
often
you
use
some
of
these
words
and
see
if
you
can
catch
yourself
before
you
use
them
again
so
hang
in
there
young
people
so
happy
my
brother
and
i
could
make
her
smile
this
big
so
he
had
the
floor
painted
pristine
white
in
order
to
spot
any
impurities
so
here
is
an
awful
scenario
resulting
from
bias
and
stress
a
scared
rookie
investigating
a
building
with
an
unlit
staircase
shoots
and
kills
an
approaching
young
black
man
akai
gurley
so
here
we
come
to
the
bigger
question
so
he
showed
me
so
he
throws
two
guys
out
of
the
club
so
hopefully
i
can
go
on
the
same
pattern
and
just
be
intense
and
be
ready
to
play
a
playoff
game
here
so
how
big
of
a
problem
is
late
enrollment
so
how
can
the
baristas
tell
the
cash
hes
handing
them
is
fake
so
how
did
it
all
come
to
this
so
how
did
the
conference
actually
come
about
so
how
did
things
look
in
your
neck
of
the
woods
so
how
does
prayer
have
such
positive
results
so
how
does
the
lcp
operate
so
how
do
these
competitive
eaters
manage
such
extreme
gorging
so
how
profits
perform
and
how
that
moves
equity
markets
is
understandably
their
bread
and
butter
as
are
good
performances
that
arent
as
good
as
the
expectations
they
may
have
built
into
their
investment
strategy
so
i
asked
the
young
woman
seated
on
my
right
who
it
was
and
she
informed
me
that
it
was
barry
humphries
aka
dame
edna
which
of
course
brought
down
the
house
with
another
standing
ovation
so
if
boko
haram
opts
for
negotiation
the
government
will
not
be
averse
to
it
femi
adesina
a
presidential
adviser
said
in
a
recent
statement
so
if
i
get
to
line
up
at
that
race
i
will
be
so
happy
so
if
there
is
routine
security
screening
and
monitoring
of
incoming
and
outgoing
state
department
emails
anything
that
is
classified
should
have
been
flagged
so
if
these
statistics
are
available
why
has
sexual
assault
been
kept
a
hushhush
topic
for
so
long
so
if
you
are
purchasing
a
home
a
percent
down
payment
would
be
so
if
you‚re
not
making
the
first
offer
in
a
negotiation
consider
doing
so
the
research
on
how
that
anchors
negotiations
is
well
established
and
once
you
do
make
it
a
bolstering
range
so
if
you
see
a
gray
wifi
notification
at
the
top
of
your
screen
stop
downloading
the
entire
contents
of
the
library
of
congress
‚úso
if
you
want
to
see
the
maximum
punishment
a
blogger
could
get
in
bangladesh
look
at
me‚
he
said
so
i
have
to
turn
it
into
an
opportunity
to
raise
awareness
soil
moisture
was
very
short
to
short
in
the
northern
counties
so
im
hitting
the
road
to
earn
your
vote
because
its
your
time
so
i‚m
thrilled
with
how
mike
has
applied
himself
to
his
team
and
his
work
he‚s
done
great‚
so
in
theory
it
is
a
much
better
form
of
taxation
by
far
so
i
put
it
to
my
beverage
director
and
all
my
people
in
the
restaurants
and
said
alright
guys
weve
got
ta
start
finding
local
booze
so
i
put
that
in
the
first
draft
of
the
sixth
special
session
an
institute
for
fertilizer
so
i
ran
for
one
of
these
districts
and
i
won
so
i
realized
that
i
was
working
in
a
long
tradition
that
stretched
back
into
the
mists
in
a
sense
and
i
didnt
know
where
it
came
from
so
i
think
it
will
help
me
given
most
of
the
guys
will
be
looking
at
playing
four
practice
rounds
so
i
may
be
able
to
cut
back
on
my
practice
schedule
that
week
given
what
i
felt
i
have
gained
in
playing
all
four
rounds
this
week
so
i
think
that‚s
the
biggest
trouble
and
biggest
lack
of
understanding
so
i
thought
eating
bread
with
pretty
shapes
would
be
fun
so
i
took
a
burst
shot
of
the
scene
from
a
distance
and
made
a
mental
note
to
make
a
gif
using
googles
auto
awesome
as
soon
as
i
got
a
somewhat
decent
wifi
signal
so
its
got
to
dismantle
twothirds
of
its
centrifuges
so
it
shows
that
this
conflict
of
having
to
live
a
life
and
making
decisions
that
have
an
impact
on
your
social
life‚
in
science
it
is
totally
correlated
they
are
entangled
so
it
tells
you
everything
so
it
took
some
time
for
a
lot
of
people
to
get
used
to
it
and
become
accepting
to
it
but
once
everybody
was
on
board
and
on
the
same
page
people
realized
that
he
was
a
special
talent
so
it
was
a
great
time
for
indie
emerging
bands
and
we
were
there
making
things
happen
seligman
says
so
it
was
my
way
of
staying
connected
so
i
want
to
focus
more
on
that
through
a
new
team
so
i
would
suggest
that
we
do
everything
that
we
can
to
try
to
resolve
these
conflicts
which
are
not
easy
so
just
those
type
of
things‚
so
keeping
as
many
of
her
colleagues
on
board
with
her
policies
is
important
in
wielding
power
so
labour
supporters
god
knows
who
else
will
get
their
ballot
papers
via
email
tomorrow
so
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
officially
running
for
president
of
the
united
states
and
we
are
going
to
make
our
country
great
again

racist
some
critics
say
children
are
going
to
eat
junk
food
because
it
tastes
good
and
that‚s
what
they
like
but
i
say
they
don‚t
give
kids
enough
credit
some
critics
worried
the

went
too
far
in
banning

from
such

raising
concerns
it
would
prevent
legitimate

aimed
at
an
adult

some
have
gained
fame

for
work
that
in
the
case
of
tanehisi
coates
landed
him
atop
bestseller
lists
for
what
he
has
written
about

some
homes
in
the
rural
farming
village
were
barely
standing
and
many
had
shifted
from
their
foundations
somehow
her

twigged
a

in

somehow
the

is
at

modern

classical
purposeful
and
stylish
some
infrastructural
damage
has
been
reported
in

a

some

some
key

are
in

where
commodities
were
the
top
driver
of

for
the

some
key
questions
remain
‚
will
russia
limit
itself
to
providing
weapons
training
and
advice
to
the
syrians
as
it
has
done
before
or
will
it
send
its
soldiers
into
actual
combat
some
kids
later
signed
affidavits
saying
that
they
had
been
pressured
by
michigan
to

even
threatened

some

called
on

administration
fra
the

chief
rail
regulator

provide
guidance
on

grant

for
how
long
some
leaders

had
warned

called

some
lgbt
children
reportedly
run
away
from

because
of
the

they
face
some
material
may
be
inappropriate
for

under
some
may
think
this
would
be
too
risky
a
move
for
the
democratic
party
given
the
elections
some
media
outlets
reported
the
man
had
bombs
in
his
car
though
officials
now
say
that
none
was
found
some
might
see
it
as
a
way
to
integrate
or
a
small
price
to
pay
for
progress
but
i
think
that
in
the
long
run
it
has
and
it
will
have
much
greater
cultural
impact
some

hits
in
he
made
an

for

giulianis
mayoral
campaign
that
revolved
around

some
of
his
ideas
could
be
enacted
through
the

executive
powers
while
others
would
require
an
act
of
congress
or
changes
in
federal
regulations
some
of
it
is
related
to
education
some
of
the
animals
were
caught
in
the
wild
to
be
used
for
medical
testing
while
others
were
purchased
after

some
of

from

it
was
obvious
mickey

was
popular
though
he
could
also
be
a
little
shy
and
formal
some
of
the
land
within
the
fire
lines
is
still
burning
but
other
sections
have
burned
out
some
of

are
piled
up
so
you
can
barely
see
over

some
of

in

some

‚úsome

that
are

to
reject
the

the

folks
who
were
so
quick
to
go

in

and
said
it

take
a
few
months‚
obama

employees
on
friday
some
of
the
works
including
rembrandts
storm
on
the
sea
of
galilee
were
cut
from
their
frames
some
of
those
amounts
are
pretty
impressive
for
this
time
of
year
he
added
some
of
those
interviewed
expressed
skepticism
but
noted
that
they
could
not
know
what
had
happened
behind
closed
doors
some
of
those
publications
also
claimed
that
the
phone
will
have
a
inch
curved
quad
hd
display
but
theres
probably
no
use
speculating
if
thats
true
or
not
when
were
this
near
to
seeing
the
real
thing
some
of
those
savings
are
invested
domestically
and
some
in
foreign
assets
some
of
those
who
have
received
trump
organization
warnings
have
in
turn
slammed
him
for
what
they
contend
is
his
illegal
use
of
corporate
resources
someone
at

obviously
got
a
little
too
cute
with
this

as
about
halfway
through

a
clearly
identifiable
shot
of

someone
didnt

nidaland
structures
for

are
not
as
good
everywhere
as
they

some

are
so
meeting
heavy
that
they
cause
their
teams
to
run
from

to
meeting
day
in
and
day
out
often
missing
meals
and
sneaking
out
for
bathroom
breaks
some
other

will
do
a
liquid
fast
or
might
not
fast
all

she
said
some
parts
of
new
brunswick
are
also
under
extreme
cold
alerts
some
parts
of
the

are
also
testing
‚úratio
seating‚
in
which
employees
essentially
share
desks
with
others
who
work
at
different
shifts
or
those
working
across
multiple
office
locations
the
people
close
to
the

some
people
fear
another
may
be
coming
even
though
central
bank
governor
godwin
emefiele
has
said
the
currency
is
appropriately
priced
some
people
have
hopes
of
passing
amendments
but
its
not
going
to
happen
‚úsome
people
have
ideas‚
the
publication
writes
some
people
have
said
that
i
am
too
frank
or
too
open
but
what
i
think
they
are
really
saying
is
the
subject
matter
that
you
bring
up
is
making
me
uncomfortable
some
people
held
pictures
of
the
loved
ones
they
have
lost
to
violence
some
people
just
dont
have
everything
they
need
so
were
trying
to
give
back
a
little
bit
she
said
some
people
starve
some
people

tell

that
its
unique
worldwide
some

removed
after
his

objected
some
previous

have
made
their

to

some

lie
on
their

saying
they
were
showing
solidarity
with

who
was
shot
in

some
residential
streets
had

entirely
covered

some

wearing

friday
as
they
fled
villages
with
a
large
angry
cloud
of
gray
dust
and
ash
forming
over

some
residents
in
pointe
claires
valois
village
told
cbcs
daybreak
on
monday
that
they
are
not
happy
with
the
change
some
residents
who
live
downstream
from
the
mine
and
draw
their
drinking
supplies
from
private
wells
have
reported
water
discoloration
but
there
has
been
no
immediate
evidence
of
harm
to
humans
livestock
or
wildlife
according
to
epa
officials
some
rights
reserved
some
rivalries
will
never
die
some
ruling
party
supporters
have
suggested
the
opposition
party
is
trying
to
coopt
blacks
for
broader
appeal
some
scientists
have
proposed
the
idea
of
‚òassisted
migration‚
for
bumblebees
‚
literally
relocating
the
bees
to
areas
where
they
might
thrive
some
see
bove
as
basically
pouring
gasoline
on
an
already
roaring
fire
with
no
good
reason
some
seriously
heavy
people
all
wanted
to
make
something
happen
and
they
saw
this
as
the
spot
some
small
business
owners
say
it
would
force
them
to
change
how
they
pay
staffers
cut
their
hours
or
eliminate
perks
like
bonuses
because
they
dont
have
the
money
for
overtime
for
employees
who
routinely
work
or

a

some

will
also
visit

in

some

participants
have
consented
to
postmortem
brain
autopsies
gray
noted
some
take
selfies
on

to

their

something
about

seemed
familiar
to
her
she
told
abc

something
always
felt
off
about
wading
into
an
uncanny
valley
of
plastic
instrumentation
‚
strumming
chords
by
holding
two
buttons
and
tapping
along
to
the
beat
something
like
that
would
have
caught
my
attention
coughlan
replied
some
things
make
sense
to
me
something
that
made
them
not
victims
of
the
world
but
actors
in
the
world
some
think
that
excuse
me
if
i
use

that
in

be
good
catholics
we

sometime
between

late
evening
hours
of
july
and
early
morning
of
july
one
of
our
adopted
dogs
an
american
pit
sometimes
wheelers
were
waved
on
through
since
the
sound
of
idling
wheelers
at
a
stop
sign
doesn‚t
mix
well
with
dramatic
dialogue
sometimes
a
theologist
states
an
absurd
reason
supposedly
justifying
the
ban
sometimes
companies
will
make
defensive
acquisitions
of
user
names
in
order
to
prevent
them
being
embarrassed
in
the
future
sometimes
falling
prices
or
deflation
can
be
a
serious
issue
sometimes
families
are
forced
to
spend
days
and
months
crammed
into
small
rooms
at
reception
camps
with
as
many
as
other
people
sometimes
her
grandmother
picked
a
gardenia
from
her
garden
and
put
it
in
a
glass
of
water
in
marias
room
so
she
would
wake
up
to
the
sweet
smell
sometimes
i
believe
it
and
other
times
i
dont
but
i
can
always
go
back
to
those
words
to
draw
strength
sometimes
it
might
not
come
off
but
when
we
do
play
that
way
we
win
games
of
cricket
said
morgan
sometimes
nets
are
put
up
as
barriers
between
swimmers
and
sharks
sometimes
one
shot
can
take
a
team
from
a
narrow
loss
to
a
narrow
win
sometimes
qigong
and
tai
chi
are
called
a
moving
meditation
in
which
the
mind
and
body
are
led
to
a
state
of
balance
and
equilibrium
also
known
as
homeostasis
sometimes
retailers
such
as
us
department
store
saks
with
design
house
public
school
and
others
carry
them
online
as
well
sometimes
the
central
banks
get
it
really
wrong
know
they
got
it
really
wrong
but
cant
do
much
about
it
due
to
domestic
politics
sometimes
youre
only
on
that
list
because
the
fbi
wants
to
talk
to
you
about
someone
you
know
not
because
youre
a
suspect
rubio
said
some
tried
to
break
the
security
cordon
leading
to
clashes
with
the
police
‚úsome
turn
to
the
dark
and
some
try
and
keep
hope
alive‚
some
tweeters
were
a
little
more
forgiving
suggesting
she
be
given
a
chance
some
ups
ups
packages
were
delayed
as
well
though
fedexs
rival
seemed
to
be
less
impacted
by
the
storms
some
us
retailers
such
as
target
tgtand
walmart
wmt
generally
benefit
from
the
dollars
strength
since
importing
goods
less
expensive
some
us
sanctions
not
related
to
the
nuclear
file
will
remain
in
place
but
that
has
not
deterred
foreign
business
delegations
that
have
flocked
to
tehran
ahead
of
the
expected
opening
of
markets
in
the
oilrich
nation
of
million
people
some
versions
of
the
vehicle
have
six
pivoting
wheels
for
maneuverability
some
were
increased
some
were
marked
breekbaar
dutch
for
fragile
some
were
permanently
injured
some
wore
blue
and
green
some
younger
parents
are
the
ones
who
question
the
need
for
vaccinations
while
those
of
us
in
the
older
generations
remember
the
development
of
childhood
vaccines
as
a
godsend
so
microbes
that
can
modulate
the
immune
system
and
limit
inflammation
may
have
some
benefit
either
by
alleviating
the
symptoms
of
certain
types
of
psychiatric
disorders
or
in
the
best
possible
scenario
preventing
them
so
mostly
lincoln
and
his
tank
mate
nemo
invested
stay
in
constant
motion
in
an
inaccessible
welllit
temperate
tank
circling
each
other
in
a
delicate
dance
so
much
for
writing
manning
off
so
my
quest
is
how
do
we
get
those
extra
years
so
national
interest
is
secondary
so
nature
keeps
the
reverent
frame
with
which
her
years
began
and
all
her
signs
and
voices
shame
the
prayerless
heart
of

next

you
catch

your

thwart

scroll

sony
made
so
much

off

soon

dr

lawyer
used
his
records
to
crossexamine
her
on
everything
from
drug
use
to
the

soon
after
his
arrival
there
his
father
says
that
he
and
his
wife
began
receiving
bills
from
a
dentonarea
pharmacy
soon
after
the
faa
issued
a
waiver
excusing
scaled
composites
from

even
though
the

had
never
asked

so
once
you
come

sorry

dont

an
outburst
so
she
decided
to
sell
her
artisan

forming
the
canyon
creek
soap
co
in
amarillo
tex
in
so
she
does
indeed
tweet
about
women
in
tech
so
she
let
us
in
on
how
she
manages
it
so
she‚ll
feel
lighter
right
away‚
so
should
european
unity
so
slow
has
the
influx
of
goods
been
that
the
united
nations
last
month
said
it
could
take
years
to
repair
the
damage
so
somehow
we‚ve
tacked
a
hundred
bucks
past
inflation
onto
the
value
of
what
is
euphemistically
still
called
the
city‚s
arts
festival
so
sorry
kids
chances
are
you
wont
be
spending
your
time
drinking
martinis
driving
aston
martins
and
flying
helicopters
upside
down
so
that
being
said
it
is
going
to
enhance
the
rivalry
there
is
no
question
about
it‚
he
added
so
that
makes
it
very
exciting
bennett
says
so
thats
nearly
more
individuals
trying
to
get
to
work
and
clogging
up
roadways
so
the
final
score
was
somewhat
inflated
so
the
company
needs
to
find
ways
to
cut
back
spending
‚
and
its
turning
to
its
employees
to
make
up
some
of
that
extra
cash
so
the
law
was
changed
to
account
for
say
repeated
withdrawals
of
over
a
regular
period
so
then
im
ok
like
where
so
then
why
is
it
spreading
in
south
korea
so
the
obama
administration
late
last
year
announced
funding
for
law
enforcement
cameras
and
police
departments
across
the
country
have
been
adopting
cameras
more
rapidly
ever
since
so
the
parties
do
have
at
least
a
reason
to
talk
so
the
real
question
i
asked
myself
when
i
heard
this
person
say
they
have
a
good
life
was
do
i
have
one
so
the
refugees
think
whos
this
‚úso
there
is
no
need
to
amend
the
constitution
on
this
particular
issue
let
alone
put
it
in
the
same
article
with
the
voting
age
which
is
articulated
in
the
current
constitution‚
she
said
so
there
will
be
teaching
sessions
there
will
be
educationals
there
will
be
memos
there
will
be
everything
any
way
you
can
get
the
information
out
so
the
state
has
the
tools
and
the
potential
to
fight
the
mob
and
not
the
other
way
round
so
theyll
start
with
the
students
in
kindergarten
he
explains
and
when
the
students
move
to
grade
that
educational
assistant
will
follow
so
they
must
be
encouraged
to
move
away
before
the
exhumation
can
commence
so
thinks
bud
caddell
founding
member
of
consulting
firm
nobl
who
has
set
as
a
goal
converting
the
company
currently
configured
as
an
llc
into
a
workerowned
cooperative
by
january
so
this
current
situation
is
mortifying
and
for
these
traumatised
women
it
can
cause
so
much
anxiety
that
some
cant
even
sleep
so
this
story
i‚ve
always
told
myself
about
myself
might
not
be
quite
true
so
those
are
some
of
the
areas
that
i
think
weve
got
to
move
on
so
to
all
of
you
who
are
formula
feeders
here
is
my
letter
to
you
so
today
with
one
voice
we
launch
our
collective
fightback
against
those
who
wish
to
do
us
harm
‚úso
to
me
i
am
pleased
for
the
guys
so
travelling
before
that
time
is
the
safest
so

england
collected
first
team
ozark
conference
baseball
honors
this
season
so
we
are
testing
it
with
users
and
household
objects
and
trying
to
come
to
a
compromise
that
means
it
is
very
affordable
and
still
has
enough
power
to
do
most
of
the
stuff
that
people
want
so
we
basically
have
a
heater
the
size
of
a
blow
dryer
heating
a
square
foot
house
so
we
did
the
interview
over
the
phone
because
he
was
concerned
about
that
so
wed
like
to
remind
people
take
those
packages
out
of
your
car
and
then
lock
it
up
so
we
have
come
full
circle
in
a
way
so
we
just
had
to
prepare
and
ultimately
regardless
of
who
is
pitching
we
just
need
to
have
good
atbats
and
see
the
ball
so
were
able
to
print
something
in
far
fewer
pieces
and
then
have
flexible
joints
so
were
literally
talking
about
a
halfinch
lower
or
had
the
firefighter
standing
next
to
him
been
about
inches
forward
it
would
have
been
a
direct
shot
the
head
alter
said
so
we
see
some
really
extreme
movements
and
then
we
see
some
fairly
small
ones
said
brook
so
we
still
see
a
lot
of
people
coming
back
to
access
old
photos
so
we
wanted
to
shake
things
up
a
bit
and
come
up
with
some
beers
that
are
different
from
what
people
are
used
to
drinking
in
belgium
so
what
about
the
story
so
what
about
windows
update
for
business
so
what
can
we
do
against
so
monstrous
a
lie
so
what
does
science
tell
us
so
what
do
you
do
if
youre
a
young
person
with
limited
connectivity
so
what
happens
is
that
when
you
insert
your
disc
into
the
xbox
one
you‚ll
have
to
download
the
modified
version
of
said
game
so
what
it
means
is
we
just
have
to
recalibrate
a
few
things
around
advertising
and
expenditures
said
charlottetown
ndp
candidate
joe
byrne
so
whats
next
for
keurig
stock
so
what‚s
wrong
with
that
so
what
was
he
looking
at
so
what
was
really
weird
but
also
interesting
was
they
said
okay
well
herb
why
dont
you
write
the
first
fifteen
hundred
words
and
come
up
with
chapter
titles
so
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
come
with
a
striking
design
so
when
a
vintage
is
declared
this
is
something
special
so
when
he
first
came
across
gissendaner
he
understood
how
she
too
had
found
god
and
theology
so
when
im
in
utah
at
the
sundance
festival
and
an
asian
brother
comes
up
to
me
and
breaks
down
in
my
arms
and
says
monique
i
am
mary
jones
do
you
know
thats
the
biggest
award
you
could
receive
so
when
the
phrase
once
in
a
blue
moon
was
coined
it
meant
something
so
rare
youd
be
lucky
or
unlucky
to
see
in
your
lifetime
according
to
nasas
national
space
science
data
center
so
when
you
change
time
zones
adjust
your
mealtimes
and
skip
your
normal
workouts
you
can
get
backed
up
so
when
you
hear
laughter
or
cheering
in
the
next
room
you
might
want
to
check
your
phone
tablet
or
laptop
to
watch
it
when
the
online
video
catches
up
so
whether
youre
constructing
an
apartment
building
the
alterations
for
your
new
office
space
or
a
custom
home
learn
from
the
painful
lessons
of
others
so
while
hammering
the
leafs
looks
good
on
the
jets
right
now
lets
just
wait
and
see
how
it
holds
up
through
the
next
couple
weeks
so
while
it
is
all
dependent
on
the
overall
market
ponsi
could
easily
see
the
stock
hitting
without
much
difficulty
so
while
its
a
huge
move
for
hulu
theres
still
an
open
door
for
future
licensing
deals
to
be
excluded
from
the
adfree
content
grouping
so
whos
going
to
watch
these
people
when
they
go
out
on
parole
he
said
so
whos
no
and
remember
the
committee
is
judging
the
teams
full
body
of
work
so
why
are
we
surprised
at
people
hating
us
so
why
bother
doing
these
experiments
at
all
so
why
not
consider
a
local
indie
theater
that
cashes
in
on
the
trend
toward
combining
movies
with
meals
so
will
keeping

forces
in

even
longer
suddenly
transform

effective

machine

that
act
started
a
movement
eventually
giving
all
women
in
ontario
the
legal
right
to
expose
their
breasts
that
agreement
culminated
with
obamas
uturn
on
his
infamous
red
lines
that
allowed
him
to
hold
a
oneshot
lead
over

jaco
van

shot

an

that
also
easily
topped
projections
that
had
it
debuting
in
the
million
to
million
range
although
in
retrospect
those
estimates
were
overly
conservative
given
that
advance
ticket
sales
were
unusually
strong
that
also
makes
the
tooth
the
oldest
hominin
remains
ever
found
in
france
by
about
years
that
and
the
countrys
geographic
isolation
make
it
substantially
less
vulnerable
to
such
a
threat‚which
one
official
source
told
worldcrunch
has
existed
for
decades
in
europe
because
of
an
open
border
within
eu
nations
that
appears
to
have
happened
again
that
being
said
he
fears
the
continental
agenda
could
be
destined
for
the
backburner
as
the
obama
administration
prepares
its
exit
and
an
incoming
administration
faces
daunting
domestic
challenges
that
being
said
it
is
also
important
for
companies
to
slice
and
dice
their
consumers
into
different
brackets
and
carefully
construct
their
target
messaging
which
in
turn
would
result
in
better
conversions
that
breath
of
mine
what
a
gift
that
brought
a
total
of
recalls
involving
more
than
million
vehicles
that
cant
be
said
of
his
newer
works
however
that
case
was
later
settled
out
of
court
according
to
the
lawsuit
‚úthat
comes
from
winning
football
games
and
being
successful

comment
drew
an
immediate
reaction
from

paul
rky

compares
with
wednesday‚s
close

the
lower
end
of
the

below
the

which
the
benchmark
bottomed
in
january
that
cost
climbs
to
among
homeowners
with
a
mortgage
but
that
dips
to
for
retirees
who
have
paid
off
their

could
be
a
high

could
mean

out

that
decision
unsettled
some
investors
because
it
suggests
that
the

not
confident
about
the

said
earlier
this
month
that
eagerness

can
in

partly
be
put
down
to
the
stress
organisations
went
through
in
moving

when

ended

that
effect
doesnt

up

exact

the

still
there
that

is
the
idea
behind
microsofts
universal

approach
that
fear
has
was
only
made
worse
after

as

to

over

followed

overly
optimistic

said
nigel

of

that
happened
in

that
has
not
been
done
under

now
has

all
across

has
the
potential
to
drive

that

bounced

was
no

to

monte
kohler
that
hollow
tagging
nagging
in
the
gut
that
unscratchableitch
frustration
of
desiring
that
thing
that
immaturity
creates
a
greater
propensity
for
crime
that
implies
a
rise
of
just
from
current
levels
that
included
a
record
of
zerofor

that
includes
camcorders
and
digital

including
eight
catches
for

and
a
touchdown
in
arizonas
upset
win
over
carolina
in
the
divisional
playoffs
that
influence
extends
to
the
playing
fields
at
the
high
school
from
undefeated
seasons
at
the
turn
of
the
th
century
to
upsetting
westwood
on
its
way
to
a
super
bowl
to
cheering
on
the
warriors
this
fall
that
in
turn
leads
to
demand
for
more
lanes
that
in
turn
was
the
highest
since
the
us
supreme
court
reinstated
the
death
penalty
in
that
is
also
the
reason
they
are
hosting
the

cup
that
is
as
valid
if
not
more
so
than
voting
based
on
selfinterest
alone
that
is
crucial
because
us
and
japanese
officials
are
negotiating
new
bilateral
security
guidelines
expected
to
give
japan
a
bigger
role
in
the
alliance
years
after
the
end
of

war
two
that
is
good
for
conservation
but
means
less
money
for
water
systems
which
charge
customers
based
on
the
amount
used
that
is
good
news
for
providers
who
need
the
confidence
to
invest
in
more
projects
that
is
momentum
he
could
harness
heading
into
what
will
be
a
critical
fourweek
juncture
in
the
primary
that
includes
the
highly
anticipated
jeffersonjackson
dinner
in
des

iowa
on

‚
where
each

says

friedrich
of

ev
an

for

seeking

is
not
a
problem
for
us
from
right
now
to
start
holding
discussions

dialogues
so
as
to
determine
and
reach
the
conclusion
of
the
next
plan
of
action
after
the
terrorists
are
driven
out
that
territory
rouhani
said
in
an
interview
to
npr
radio
that
is
not
to
say
buffett
is
any
kind
of
a
slouch
that
is
not
unreasonable
in
an
era
when
the
number
of
media
jobs
is
shrinking
that
isnt
on
csubs
shoulders
that
is
our
duty
as
americans
today
that
is
particularly
true
in
chiasso
a
town
of
people
that
has
historically
served
as
the
main
migrant
gateway
to
switzerland
that
is
something
for
which
i
can
not
take
a
personal
decision
to
impact
an
entire
population
said
hanna
that
is
still
good
meat
on
that
fuckin‚
fish
kid
‚úthat
is
the
real
key
that
is
the
scary
part
that
is
true
despite
the
captain
having
said
he
planned
to
take
the
ship
along
a
route
that
would
pass
about
miles
from
the
storms
center
according
to
the
ntsb
that
is
unacceptable
to
me
that
is
what
i
wish
for
you
this
christmas
that
is
where
it
begins
and
ends
that
is
why
she
ran
in
the
rae
town
division
in
and
the
general
election
in
that
is
why
the
world
leaders
march
in
the
sunday
paris
rally
drew
such
criticism
that
is
why
we
as
a
nation
need
to
practice
understanding
not
stigmatization
that
is
why
we
will
be
entirely
open
with
the
findings
of
this
report
to
hope
that
regulators
and
companies
around
the
world
benefit
from
that
learning
so
that
something
like
this
never
happens
again
andrew
mackenzie
told
an
analysts
call
that
just
doesnt
happen
that
kind
of
voter
loyalty
has
republican
party
leaders
asking
themselves
if
trump
were
to
mount
an
independent
bid
would
that
cost
them
the
white
house
that
latter
activity
is
logistically
easy
because
she
says
‚úfor
political
reasons
he
has
access
to
a
large
collection
of
rubber
rafts‚
that
led
to
the
twoway
walkietalkie
and
carphones
that
makes
data
capture
more
comprehensive
and
allows
multiple
data
streams
to
be
correlated
that
makes
it
a
good
bet
as
todays
major
finding
but
tune
in
to
nasa
tv
or
come
back
here
at
am
et
to
find
out
for
sure
that
makes
it
easier
for
lawmakers
to
recycle
similar
language
from
the
previous
statements
that
makes
me
really
mad
that
makes
one
conclude
there‚s
no
reason
russell
wilson‚s
current
hot
streak
has
to
end
this
week
that
makes
sense
fox
said
because
psychopathy
is
characterized
by
impulsivity
that
may
be
the
possibility
for
million
members
of
adult
friendfinder
whose
information
might
now
be
on
the
open
web
that
may
include
some
particularly
bright
ones
known
as
fireballs
that
the
perseids
are
known
for
that
may
sound
strange
but
we
all
have
a
connection
to
our
surroundings
that
means
carrying
a
balance
for
even
one
month
at
that
rate
could
wipe
out
a
years
worth
of
penny
pinching
that
means
eating
a
cup
of
cooked
spinach
a
day
may
give
you
more
lasting
power
on
the
elliptical
machine
or
in
your
daily
sprint
to
catch
the
bus
that
means
extra
work
in
particular
with
receivers
brandon
marshall
and
eric
decker
who
were
developing
a
solid
rapport
this
summer
with
smith
that
means
finding
something
that
is
an
emotional
connection
finding
something
that
excites
them
personally
and
really
figuring
out
how
to
bring
that
into
the
brand
she
said
that
means
it
is
even
more
important
that
colleges
find
ways
to
work
with
students
to
teach
them
that
and
to
model
that
for
them
that
means
keeping
the
meat
cold
washing
your
hands
and
cleaning
surfaces
that
touched
the
raw
meat
that
means
that
poisonous
berries
have
likely
been
removed
and
instead
of
real
animals
there
will
be
actors
in
suits
that
means
that
rather
than
hashing
everything
out
at
the
actual
meeting
in
december
the
big
countries
are
deciding
now
how
much
climate
pollution
they
will
agree
to
cut
that
means
the
average
payout
is
worth
roughly
times
their
monthly
wage
and
tops
the
average
wall
street
bonus
for
by
that
means
the
conversation
is
shifting
from
forecasts
about
how
oil
prices
the
global
economic
slowdown
and
currency
moves
to
actual
numbers
that
means
the
patient
has
to
pay
nearly
a
third
of
the
drugs
cost
after
the
deductible
is
met
that
means
the
salty
chewy
cheese
may
only
be
called
halloumi
if
it
produced
on
cyprus
itself
that
means
the
social
security
administration
hasnt
yet
announced
whether
there
will
be
a
cola
or
how
big
for
next
year
‚
official
word
wont
come
until
the
latter
part
of
october
after
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
reports
on
september
inflation
that
means
whatever
company
provides
your
internet
connection
even
if
its
to
your
phone
will
now
have
to
act
in
the
public
interest
and
not
do
anything
that
might
be
considered
unjust
or
unreasonable
that
means
you‚ll
apply
using
your
social
security
number
even
if
you
offer
your
federal
employer
identification
number
fein
on
the
application
that
meant
the
countys
residents
had
a
nearly
onein
chance
of
being
selected
that
might
be
true
in
the
short
term
maybe
the
success
of
microsoft‚s
premium
devices
will
also
help
oems
raise
their
profit
margins
a
few
points
that
mode
of
travel
adds
an
adventurous
element
to
the
film
but
to
saupers
credit
he
never
lets
that
get
in
the
way
of
his
grim
challenge
to
all
the
existing
answers
to
the
problems
in
sudan‚and
in
the
larger
sense
much
of
africa
that
moment
in
iowa
proved
to
be
walkers
high
point
that
motion
sponsored
by
council
members
rod
dembowski
larry
gossett
and
jane
hague
requested
that
county
executive
dow
constantine
develop
a
cost
analysis
recommendation
and
a
work
plan
that
needs
american
support
and
understanding
that
northwesterly
breeze
is
going
to
swing
around
and
start
coming
out
of
the
south
later
today
that
nostalgia
worked
for
tony
brennan
who
said
he
cant
get
off
of
that
high
that
im
on
after
seeing
the
film
with
the
openingnight
crowd
in
hollywood
that
october
governor
phips
returned
to
the
city
and
found
that
his
wife
was
among
those
accused
that
old
adage
that
you
meet
the
same
people
on
the
way
up
as
on
the
way
down
is
very
true
in
business
and
you
never
know
when
the
people
you
stepped
on
will
be
the
same
people
you
will
be
looking
to
for
an
opportunity
that
opened
up
the
middle
and
riley
peters
made
the
right
choice
got
on
his
horse
and
got
down
there
and
got
it
in
that
other
part
of
valor
in
one
of
the
great
ironies
of
my
work
on
north
korea
when
i
was
actually
visiting
the
country
between
and
i
couldnt
write
about
what
i
saw
or
the
discussions
i
had
there
that
pain
you
feel
in
your
bones
in
every
cell
in
your
body
that
peace
push
proposed
by
the
uns
syria
envoy
staffan
de
mistura
is
expected
to
be
implemented
later
this
month
that
phase
will
include
the
removal
of
the
recycled
asphalt
and
installation
of
a
concrete
slab
granite
curb
and
paver
stones
and
decorative
light
benches
and
trees
that
photography
fetish
could
be
overloading
your
device
and
cloud
storage
isnt
always
the
best
at
searching
and
organizing
media
files
that
position
potentially
puts
him
at
odds
with
the
reforms
cameron
is
seeking
which
include
restricting
migrants
access
to
benefits
and
reducing
barriers
to
trade
in
the
single
eu
market
that
potential
remains
largely
untapped
only
about
percent
of
influential
companies
tracked
by
a
new
report
have
overarching
zero
deforestation
policies
in
place
that
pressure
comes
from
the
conflict
between
the
need
for
green
spaces
and
the
need
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
reducing
commuting
distances
through
more
dense
urban
living
that
program
plans
to
expand

years

faster

that
refusal
was
followed
by

and
then
the

that

also
criticizes
the

on

that
it

that

was
the
second
critical

of
the

for
protecting

that
separates
itself
from

around
this
common
threat
and
works

he
said
that
review
is
expected
to
last
several
months
that
role
was
one
of
the
very
last
to
be
cast
remembers
stern
of
the
gosling
part
thats
about
double
the
amount
that
typically
falls
in
the
region
for
all
of
september
it
said
thats
a
form
of
deception
as
well
but
the
evidence
suggests
that
the
candidates
who
are
best
at
conveying
a
persona
which
is
not
their
own
actually
tend
to
be
the
ones
who
win
elections
thats
after
paying
their
drivers
which
theyre
experimenting
with
doing
a
little
less
thats
a
huge
reach
thats
a
label
that
no
female
candidate
should
have
to
wear
thats
all
i
could
think
about
thats
also
something
we
didnt
know
before

iraq
in
april
that
same
month
the
pac
paid
to
a
massage
parlor
for
a
fundraising
event
thats
an
acknowledgement
of
the
vast
inequities
of
climate
change
the
fact
that
the
richest
most
powerful
countries
have
done
the
most
to
cause
climate
change
yet
suffer
the
least
as
a
result
thats
an
upgrade
from
the
sixbed
eightweek
day
treatment
program
that
was
offered
in
charlottetown
thats
a
politically
libertarian
stance
that
tells
government
to
stay
out
of
what
doesnt
concern
you
thats
a
real
big
first
for
a
region
thats
as
far
back
as
the
florida
state
bar
keeps
such
records
thats
a
very
important
portal
in
the
lore
of
ingress
he
says
referring
to
the
dramatic
scifi
backstory
created
by
niantic
which
incidentally
no
agent
ive
ever
met
seems
to
pay
much
attention
to
thats
a
very
very
big
bet
on
one
company
thats
because
from
january
st
any
new
taxi
seeking
a
licence
will
need
to
be
zero
emission
capable
like
the
tx
thats
because
it
threatens
the
very
fabric
of
the
nhs
with
its
potentially
highly
profitable
parts
becoming
sitting
ducks
in
the
deadly
crosshairs
of
big
american
business
thats
because
rodgers
didnt
throw
to
shermans
side
of
the
field
once
that‚s
because
the
workforce
in
renton
reached
unprecedented
levels
of
productivity
in
ramping
up
to
jets
per
month
that‚s
because
the
big
puts
its
teams
through
a
doubleround
robin
schedule
with
everybody
playing
everybody
else
at
home
and
away
that‚s
because
these
taxes
reduce
the
wages
that
businesses
are
willing
to
pay
that‚s
because
they
‚úassume
that
they
have
to
save
so
much
more
and
a
little
bit
isn‚t
going
to
make
a
difference‚
thats
considerable
massey
says
thats
despite
an
inquiry
report
on
polo
park
traffic
which
recommended
the
city
take
all
his
land
that
sector
is
entirely
under
russia
and
prorussian
rebel
control
and
is
used
according
to
kiev
as
a
conduit
for
separatist
supplies
something
the
kremlin
denies
that
seems
to
be
microsofts
strategy
of
late
that
sends
the
wrong
message
if
you
do
it
and
get
caught
just
tell
us
all
you
know
and
well
lower
your
ban
thats
especially
true
in
recent
days
as
the
senate
considers
extending
surveillance
powers
granted
to
the
national
security
agency
prompting
the
partys
candidates
lash
out
at
each
other
and
clinton
that‚s
exactly
what
the
government
asserts
sp
did
in
ratings
on
billions
of
dollars
of
securities
it
issued
from
through
thats
fine
too
thats
frank
maloney
exclaimed
one
of
the
small
crowd
who
had
gathered
around
the
bewildered
man
better
recognized
as
the
toughtalking
manager
behind
former
heavyweight
champion
of
the
world
lennox
lewis
thats
how
an
enthusiastic
first
lady
michelle
obama
kicked
off
the
blushing
bearded
royals
whirlwind
trip
to
the
united
states
wednesday
which
included
an
informal
meeting
with
president
barack
obama
and
a
trip
to
the
british
embassy
thats
how
i
feel
about
tiff
vallee
said
in
a
statement
referring
to
the
festival
thats
if
the
predictions
of
dutch
company
infostrada
come
to
pass
follow
cnnsport
the
statistics
firm
tracks
events
around
the
world
in
all
olympic
sports
then
converts
those
results
into
a
formula
to
predict
who
will
win
each
olympic
medal
thats
impossible
to
say
there
are
so
many
foreign
chefs
who
have
opened
restaurants
in
paris
thats
interesting
to
me
amir
says
that
situation
devolved
into
a
brawl
allegedly
involving
pitchforks
and
shovels
thats
just
a
testament
to
our
defense
and
how
weve
been
trying
to
bring
pressure
all
year
thats
just
really
part
of
the
design
process
is
really
thinking
about
how
you
are
going
to
use
the
product
and
walking
through
the
steps
that
make
sense
to
you
in
your
head
hurley
said
that‚s
just
what
the
cons
are
counting
on
thats
less
time
than
it
takes
usain
bolt
to
run
the
meter
dash
thats
making
apple
look
like
the
bum
fruit
of
the
crop
thats
more
than
million
even
at
todays
rates
but
outside
of
the
bitcoin
community
few
people
raised
an
eyebrow
at
the
heist
thats
more
than
double
the
average
for
carmakers
that‚s
more
than
double
the
rate
of
inflation
overall
thats
more
than
the
people
who
greek
officials
said
were
officially
on
the
ferry
‚
leading
to
questions
about
italys
tally
or
suggestions
that
the
ferry
also
carried
an
unknown
number
of
unregistered
migrants
that‚s
more
than
three
times
the
ascent
the
nasdaq
has
risen
in
the
past
two
years
thats
my
guess
thats
not
a
typo
or
an
oversight
this
squad
is
two
defenders
away
from
full
strength
thats
not
fear
mongering
its
simply
stating
that
trusting
christ
to
give
us
what
we
need
and
sustain
us
is
not
near
as
dangerous
as
trusting
a
system
that
is
bound
to
collapse
thats
not
going
to
happen
to
be
criminally
prosecuted
as
a
federal
matter
but
there
are
all
these
ways
in
which
its
to
eat
you
legality
federally
thats
not
its
only
worry
thats
not
possible
with
winterkorn
at
the
top
that‚s
not
sitting
well
with
schultz
that
softened
the
blow
of
missing
the
opportunity
to
close
things
out
in
six
in
detroit
thats
one
of
the
driving
questions
of
the
journal
thats
one
reason
apple
limited
initial
sales
to
just
online
orders
thats
one
reason
why
earlier
this
month
ontario
premier
kathleen
wynne
embarked
on
her
first
official
mission
to
california
thats
on
top
of
multibillion
dollar
fines
volkswagen
could
be
subject
to
that
sounds
like
growth
clarke
told
jurors
wednesday
that
sparked
a
backlash
from
some
local
groups
thats
particularly
bad
news
because
the
company
unveiled
a
new
model
the
keurig
in
august
thats
part
of
it
thats
pretty
much
it
but
gale
and
zemeckis
build
the
story
in
such
a
way
that
everything
that
occurs
early
on
serves
as
a
setup
for
a
payoff
you
might
not
realize
is
going
to
come
later
thats
really
close
to
the
record
high
of
set
in
thats
really
put
pressure
on
the
schools
particularly
those
that
serve
our
neediest
students
that‚s
slightly
less
than
the
planned
fee
that
will
take
effect
the
rest
of
the
year
thats
something
weve
been
working
on
for
a
period
of
time
dimondstein
said
thats
such
a
reasonable
request
the
reverend
says
that‚s
the
answer
for
the
team
behind
glow
that‚s
the
beauty
of
it
right
thats
the
big
thing
with
kids
today
when
youre
watching
them
play
is
do
they
have
the
potential
to
become
major
league
baseball
players
thats
the
challenge
mosques
and
western
governments
will
have
to
deal
with
shaikh
said
thats
the
first
time
since
that
the
unemployment
rate
has
been
above
yearago
levels
bmo
economist
doug
porter
said
not
good
thats
the
heart
of
our
community
thats
the
highest
mark
in
four
years
according
to
the
commerce
department
but
economist
and
policymakers
want
to
see
growth
this
year
of
a
lot
closer
to
thats
the
intent
of
ab
a
bill
under
consideration
in
sacramento
thats
the
least
you
need
to
painstakingly
recreate
classic
star
wars
scenes
from
single
sheets
of
paper
using
a
knife
kirigami
style
that‚s
the
lesson
jeb
learned
when
he
ran
for
governor
of
florida
the
first
time
unsuccessfully
in
thats
the
problem
with
testament
and
many
similar
films
they
appear
to
oppose
war
but
they
accept
it
as
a
given
a
pretext
for
unspooling
tales
of
lives
uprooted
and
love
lost
thats
the
reality
of
the
syrians
thats
the
thing
because
the
only
people
who
want
to
vote
yes
are
those
who
have
a
lot
of
money
that‚s
the
world
we
live
in
in
these
days
with
social
media
and
the
rallies
that
study
also
from
destatis
found
that
germans
work
an
average
of
hours
per
week
nearly
two
hours
more
than
years
ago
that‚s
up
from
last
year
and
in
thats
very
important
with
global
travel
says
schwartz
thats
well
below
the
billion
cubic
feet
thought
to
be
there
in
even
after
accounting
for
about
billion
cubic
feet
of
gas
production
in
the
years
since
thats
what
adventure
man
bear
grylls
did
to
kate
winslet
on
running
wild
when
he
asked
her
to
spread
her
arms
out
wide
thats
what
bradley
hampton
saw
from
the
plane
he
was
on
about
to
yards
away
thats
what
comic
kevin
pollack
wanted
to
discover
in
his
documentary
misery
loves
comedy
which
premiered
friday
at
the
sundance
film
festival
thats
what
drew
him
to
lisbeth
salander
to
the
extent
that
she
began
to
inhabit
his
dreams
while
he
was
writing
the
new
book
thats
what
i
learned
from
my
arabic
brothers
and
sisters
that‚s
what
makes
us
exceptional
‚úthat‚s
what‚s
so
cool
about
it
thats
what
struck
me
his
childish
face
very
determined
cold
calm
frightening
thats
what
this
is
thats
what
worries
me
thats
when
he
touches
her
buttocks
and
quickly
bolts
away
thats
when
the
trouble
started
thats
when
we
learn
the
latest
figures
on
job
creation
and
unemployment
thats
where
the
fruit
is
thats
why
all
their
presidential
tax
plans
would
roughly
increase
the
national
debt
by
between
and
trillion
thats
why
he
loved
the
situation
in
his
two
terms
of
goldmedal
success
with
the
canadian
olympic
team
thats
why
hospitals
around
the
treasure
valley
practice
handling
these
kind
of
situations
each
year
although
years
can
go
by
without
a
masscasualty
incident
thats
why
i
hire
agent
mark
rodgers
and
thats
why
i
trust
him
to
figure
everything
out
for
me
work
everything
out
and
sure
enough
it
did
and
i
get
to
play
here
for
another
four
more
years
thats
why
its
important
to
actively
reposition
your
legs
under
and
around
your
seat
while
sitting
but
also
to
get
up
and
stretch
them
out
to
enhance
blood
flow
thats
why
its
important
to
exercise
under
the
supervision
of
a
doctor
a
physiotherapist
a
nurse
health
coach
or
some
other
professional
that‚s
why
that
never
means
anything
to
me
that‚s
why
the
accuracy
of
‚údisparage‚
and
‚úoffend‚
is
so
important
thats
why
the
portland
airports
tsa
officers
will
notify
port
police
if
they
find
any
marijuana
on
travelers
thats
why
weve
got
some
tips
to
ensure
your
next
run
ends
in
glory
not
pain
thats
why
you
may
want
to
do
some
homework
before
you
head
to
the
store
especially
if
its
a
retailer
where
you
do
a
lot
of
business
thats
why
you
wont
see
me
out
there
and
he
doesnt
need
to
defend
me
and
hes
totally
different
from
me
the
former
president
said
according
to
politico
thats
with
you
for
life
junie
said
that
tends
to
happen
when
we
get
a
slight
drizzle
said
stenson
who
might
have
to
contend
with
more
of
the
same
as
rain
is
predicted
for
friday
that
the
foxes
are
even
attracting
talent
of
that
calibre
is
a
testament
to
how
they‚ve
grown
over
the
last
few
months
while
also
admittedly
emphasizing
the
spending
power
the
premier
league
currently
enjoys
that
there
are
backlogs
doesnt
surprise
her
there
were
when
she
was
a
crusader
for
the
cause
that
the
tension
is
that
high
is
a
bit
unbelievable
that
they
had
consciously
bought
the
volkswagen
vehicle
thinking
that
they
were
going
to
contribute
positively
to
have
a
clean
environment
and
now
theyre
disappointed
in
that
that
they
should
completely
disappear
was
amazing
that
timeframe
ends
on
july
oxycodone

a
prescription
drug
in
both

that
time
has

clinton
has
said
taught
her

how
to
be
tough
and
made
her
want

circumstances
seitzwald
adds
‚úthat

your
window

you‚re
in
where
you
don‚t

a
cubanamerican
media
consultant
in
coral
gables
told
me
that
unexplained
discrepancy
inevitably
raises
suspicion
that
perhaps
the
result
was
manipulated
that
ushered
in
a
brutal
reign
in
which
muslims
committed
atrocities
that
vibrant
opening
to
their
uefa
champions
league
campaign
was
a
stark
contrast
to
the
doom
and
gloom
that
surrounded
the
club
after
their
worst
start
to
a
season
since
that
video
will
also
show
up
in
a
new
‚
and
functional
‚
player
that
was
pesos
less
than
in
draft
regulation
seen
by
reuters
last
week
but
more
than
the
company
had
hoped
that
was
a
culture
shock
for
me
said
lockett
who
is
black
that
was
a
very
very
symbolic
act
it
elevated
the
fight
from
this
sort
of
military
tactical
and
localized
conflict
to
that
of
a
religious
and
global
war
that
was
confirmed
wednesday
by
grand
baywestfield
mayor
grace
losier
who
chairs
the
regional
commission
‚úthat
was
definitely
one
of
my
best
rounds‚
he
said
that
was
devastating
for
her
he
said
that
was
disappointing
as
well
that
was
followed
by
five
other
killings
by
a
compatriot
amedy
coulibaly
in
the
days
that
followed
that
was
just
the

of
the

that
was
my

for

i
dressed
up
as
a

pump
‚úthat

never
in

in

the

even
have

to
look

the

figure
out
what
we
need
to
do
better

give
us
some
time

work
on
that
that
will
be
the
second
priority
in
the
sense
that
your
first
duty
is
to
serve
the
people
of

that
will
get
you
a

wine
pairings

a
chance
to
hang
out
in
a
beautiful
private

you
normally
wouldnt
get
access
to
that
will
isolate
it
from
your
other

as
giving
you
a

will
mean
we
wont
have
any
trouble
bringing

make
significants
savings
in

that
while

the

the

at

where

citing

reports
say
tehran
conducted
past

work
the

had
no

the

said
it
had
sent
iran
questions
relating
to
its
submissions
about
its
past
nuclear
activities
adding
that
there
had
been
ambiguities
in
tehrans
original

the

wants
to
be
able
to

if
it

is

the
idea
behind

to
use
modern

superconductors
for

which
can
be
cooled
with

to

the
idea
hasn‚t

fleshed
out

it
seems
to
follow
the
precedent
set
by

liberal

has
announced
a

the

has
been
irresistible
to
earthlings
for
generations
the
idea
that
a
prime
minister
is
the
steward
of
the
economy
is
a
convenient
bit
of
fiction
cocreated
by
politicians

the

the
imf‚s
dour

a
clear
warning
that
the

accord
hasn‚t
removed
the
risk
of
a
greek

it‚s
a
sign

the
one
that
stands
out
the
most
is

one
in

played

the
one
thing
hillary
clinton
cant
live
without
the
one
thing
thats
critical
though
is
the
context
of
this
discussion
the
one
thing
they
all
have
in
common
is
an
understanding
and
value
of
their
own
soft
skills
the
one
thing
we
need
to
be
very
careful
not
to
do
and
im
sure
tony
agrees
with
this
what
we
must
not
do
is
play
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies
and
seek
to
tag
all
muslims
with
responsibility
for
the
crimes
of
a
few
he
said
the
one
thing
you
need
to
watch
out
for
here
is
that
clutter
doesnt
draw
attention
to
itself
in
any
way
meaning
its
not
going
to
give
you
an
occasional
popup
saying
you
have
emails
in
clutter
waiting
to
be
read

‚úthe
only
‚òdiscussion‚
would
be
if
the

have
specific
questions
of
the
presenter‚
she
added
the
only
freedom
we
have
left
is
to
choose
whose
orders
to
follow
the
only
other
presidential
candidate
who
might
see
the
world
as
it
is
is
donald
trump
the
only
other
significant
contribution
with

bat
came
from

only

the
only
problem
is
that
he
plays
alongside
david
silva
who
is
better
and
as
a
result
nasri
is
usually
stuck
out
wide
which
limits
his
effectiveness
the
only
responsibility
for
ramona

champions
is
to
fund

the
only
sound
you
hear
is
wind

ice
the
only
true
sense
of
time
that
exists
in
food
is
the
time
it
takes
for
something
to
cook
the
only
unfortunate
thing
is
that
a
lot
of
the
bones
were
broken
but
those
have
been
repaired
the
only
way
i
wouldnt
feel
as
nervous
was
to
scope
every

day
the
only
way
that
we
can
ever
hope
to
achieve
equality
is
if
we
are
willing
to
sacrifice
to
achieve
equality
the
only
way
to
change
the
situation
she
said
is
for
states
that
pursue
antimissile
capabilities
follow
the
universal
principle
of
not
trying
to
strengthen
their
security
at
the
expense
of
the
security
of
other
states
the
only
way
to
reset
an
unhappy
career
is
to
look
deeply
in
yourself
and
figure
out
what
motivates
you
and
where
you
want
to
end
up
the
onus
should
be

that

is
less
that
of

antiwar
radical
than
a
pragmatic
liberal

a

that
sometimes

weak

for

there
are
also
reports
that

not

there
are

this
is
a
step
in
the

there
are

at
the
end
there
will
be
nothing
there
are
many
reasons
why
woods

such
a
compelling
brand
proposition
but
one
of
them
has
been
his
transferability
the
ability
to
appeal

there

costa

there

about
million

reasons
why
the

government
israel
the
international

and
american
jews
as
well
as
palestinians
arab
states
and
others
should
be
focusing
on
this
as
a
priority
from
all
their
different
vantage
points
there
are
several
different
kinds
but
all
contain
a
flavorful

some
kind
of

and
the
allimportant
combo
of

bell
peppers

the

that
isnt
unusual
there
are
so
many
there
are
so
many
former
catholics
in
the
united

in
fact
that
if
they
formed
their
own

theyd
be
the
countrys
secondlargest

only
the
catholic

itself
‚úthere
are
so
many
resources
now

can
provide

and
give
young

hope‚
she
said
there
are
some
examples
at
the
moment
in
the

like
thunder
a
vessel
which
is
on
the
interpol
list
is
fishing
illegally
and
is
extremely
difficult
to
deal
with
there
are
some
private
rehabilitation
centers
but
the
costs
are
prohibitive
for
most
users
there
are
some
saving
graces
there
are
sound
reasons
for
rewarding
excellence
and
sponsoring
institutions
that
do
important
scientific
research
there
are
still
others
who
wish
to
be
a
famous
country
music
singer
a
famous
rapper
or
a
famous
real

there
are
striking
similarities
between
emwazi

the
man
known
as
jihadi

according
to
asim
qureshi
cages
research
director
there
are
studies
out
there
that
show
gps
really
do
save
lives
there
are
tensions
abroad
where
people
dont
understand
our
attachment
to
the
freedom
of
speech
hollande
said
there
are
too
many
good
things
in
life
that
i
want
to
experience
there
are
too
many
parts
of
the
economy
that
are
doing
well
there
are
two
movies
contained
in
marielle
heller‚s
‚údiary
of
a
teenage
girl‚
the
one
that‚s
on
view
and
the
one
that
it
implies
and
the
latter
is
far
superior
there
are
two
particularly
notable
extremist
groups
in
syria
firstly
isil

secondly
al
qaidalinked
jabhat
alnusra
there
are
two

there
are
very
few
things
in
any
contemporary
automobile
that
have
not
been
either
directly
developed

improved
by

there
are

are
weather
reports
of

blowing

on

the
computer
program
projected
that
dust
would
hit
eastern
washington
and
northeast
oregon
just
before
the

started
the
reasonable
republicans
the
john
kasichs
and
the
jeb
bushes
have
been
left
with
little
polling
support
to
the
point
they
may
wilt
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
the
kind
of
candidates
who
can
win
the
presidency
‚úthe
reason
for
our
existence
is
our
land
where
we
have
our
own
governance
economy
and
cultural
practices‚
said
lyndon
pishagua
chinchuya
of
the
yanesha
community
in
the
peruvian
amazon
the
reason
for
the
air
pollution
is
an
increase
in
road
traffic
and
the
booming
industrial
sector
the
reason
for
the
lower
sales
outside
of
the
us
is
that
the
devices
are
mismatched
with
infrastructure
and
consumer
expectations
in
those
markets
according
to
gartner
the
reason
for
the
moderate
reaction
is
that
many
analysts
had
expected
worse
having
been
prey
to
their
own
exaggerated
fears
the
reason
no
one
is
hating
on
landline
phones
and
fax
machines
is
that
they
don‚t
impact
our
daily
lives
anymore
the
reasons
for
that
outcome
go
beyond
the
partys
nationalist
ideology
and
include
israels
sense
of
geographic
vulnerability
its
fragmented
politics
and
a
master
campaigner
in
netanyahu
himself
the
reason
that
its
breaking
temperature
records
is
because
you
have
the
el
nino
event
on
top
of
the
fact
that
the
planet
is
slowly
warming
said
donner
the
reason
why
i
wanted

because
i
wanted

the

been

the

in
insufficient
numbers

the

in

has
caused
huge
capital
flight
the
recent

was
the
first
of
those

the
reception
has
been
phenomenal
there
certainly
seems
to
be
a
marginalization
of
their
lives
and
their
experiences
the

now
building

by

show
that

as
irresponsible
negligent

the
record
supports
this
position
regrettably
the
record
was
always
meant
to
overstay
it‚s

there
could
be

the

trailed
at

and
outscored
the

second
half
there
didnt
used

therefore
excess

should
not
go
to
lowering

he
said
but
to
growing

talent
therefore
i
am
very
honored
to
present
you
invisible

therefore
i
have
decided
to
seek
other
leadership
opportunities
where
my
skill
sets
at

will
add

therefore
many
who
might
be

dont
bother
applying
for
asylum
figuring
that
it
is
either
superfluous
or
worse
still
might
eventually
be
an
impediment
to
their
gaining
the
right
to
remain
in
germany
by
other
means
there
for
me
to
see
the
reform
is
aimed
at
speeding
up
land
acquisition
for
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
stalled
infrastructure
and
other
development
projects
to
boost

ever
since
defecting
from

there
has
also
been

on

to
fix

worst
of
their

and
be

fixing

has
been

torrent
of
revelations
lately
about
the
ability

essentially
anyone
on

to
track
your

there
has
been

for
a
week
poroshenko
said
in
televised
remarks
there
hasn‚t
been
any
further
confirmation
but
as
you
can
see
in
the
imagine
above
the
tagline
for
the
event
is
‚úwe
never
hit
pause‚
there
has
to
be
a
stopping
point
its
the
circle
of
violence
and
addiction
there
has
to
be
a
stop
to
it

have
wished
more
than
anything
she
would
just
walk
into
my
bedroom
and
sit
on
the

of
my
bed
like
she
used
to
do
there
have
been
some
rebounders
though
there
have
been
talks
about
this
going
on
in
koreatown
though
it
sounds
like
its
exclusive
to
people
who
speak
korean
and
theres
another
app
competing
for
the
same
business
called
bemydd‚however
luxe
appears
to
be
cheaper
there
have
recently
been

of

borrelia
miyamotoi
which
is
related
to
the
bacterium
that
causes
lyme

there
have
to
be
charging

everywhere
there
he
said
he
faced
a
brutal
mindnumbing
reality
that
was
nothing
like
what

envisioned

he
said
adding
that
seismic
stations
have
been
set
up
in
northeastern
bc
in
the
last
two
years
to
help
scientists
get
a
better
look
at
the
small
earthquakes
in
the
region
there
is
already
a
shortage
of
workers
in
the
care
sector
and
it
has
the
highest
turnover
rate
of
staff
in
japan
because
of
poor
pay
and
conditions
there
is
also
an
overarching
reason
as
to
why
germany
wants
a
strong
greece
there
is
also
the
ben

cap
the
southern
methodist
university
senior
wears
when
he
plays

that

‚úthere
is
a
moral
imperative

end
the
fossilfuel
era
now
there
is
a
negative
sentiment
largely
driven
by

there
is
an
expectation
of
a
conservative
aversion
against

writes
the
university
of

sondre

there
is
an
old

in

that

in

there
is
another
positive
economic
finding
from
the

worries
about
job
loss
have
dropped
since
last

there
is
a
picture
of
a
woman
with
a
inch
scar
on
her
throat
there
is
a
real
danger
these

are
forcing

there
is
a
very
big
risk
ttip
will
restrict
our
democratic
rights
there
is
bipartisan
recognition
that
obamacare
will
reduce
takehome
pay
but
the
president
is
showing
once
again
that
protecting
his
law
is
a
higher
priority
than
protecting
these
workers
wages
buck
said
in
a
statement
there
is
camaraderie
among
the
women
as
they
support
one
another
and
speak
about
how
they
have
taken
up
surrogacy
to
support
their
own
children
there
is
certainly
some
skepticism
over
his
shift
in
position
there
is
currently
a
shortage
of
over
housing

in
jordan
and
rising

prices
caused
by
the

there
is
flexibility
that
you
can
use
if
you
really
have
to
flexibility
to
devalue
the
national

and
to
shovel
funds
into
your
banking
system
without
having
to
consult
frankfurt
there
is
i
guess
a
notion
where
people
become
lifers
there
is
indeed
a
great
potential
space
and
momentum
for
further
enhanced

there
is
in

words
according
to
cowen
a
moral
but
not
legal
obligation
to
give

where
credit
is
due
there
is
just
a
pattern
here
where
the
other
side
keeps
using
the
same
old
tired
failed
policies
there
is
little
substance
to
commenting
all
day
aside
from
the
fact
that
posting
gets
issues
off
your
chest
there
is
more
competence
more
willingness
to
compromise
and
more
preparedness
data

etc
said
an
eu
official
familiar
with

there
is
much
more
work

there
is
no

pose
to
the

‚úthere
is
no

there
is
no
clear
explanation
for

it
is

it
may
be

that

there

there

to
this
there

he

ridiculous
one
thanks
to
the

acting

theres
a
sense
of
strategy
with
all
that
you
hear
theres
a
wellknown
personal
finance
expert
whos
been
known
to
tell
people
on
his
radio
show
not
to
give
to
united
way
because
he
apparently
doesnt
have
a
good
grasp
of
this
issue
and
is
offended
by
what
some
outoftown
united

did

it‚s

theres
been

rally
in

year
since
‚
except
in
and
that
was
largely
because
we
were
in
the
great
recession
theres
been
so
much
happening
already
the
researchers
also
estimated
that
unhealthy
lifestyles
were
responsible
for
almost
percent
of
heart
disease

said
the

did
their
initial
experiments
on

skin
to
limit
the

needed

reported
their
noninvasive
way
of
controlling
brain
cells
in
the
journal
nature
communications
and
stated
that
it
could
help
improve
optogenetics
which
uses
light
instead
of
sound
the
researchers
speculate
that
light
can
help
regulate
metabolism
and
that
even
to
minutes
of
bright
light
between
am
and
noon
is
enough
to
impact
your
weight
the
researchers
suggest
this
gap
may
result
from
longlasting
social
experiences
between
chimps
and
humans
the
research
isnt
quite
at
that
stage
yet
but
they
have
been
able
to
change
the
hue
of
the
roses

by
applying

is
the

of

the

will
have

beyond

the
results
according
to
the

point
to
a

drier

that
falls
far
outside

of

also
have

of

as
well
as

of

the
results
of
our
team‚s
study
of
this
comparison
don‚t
worry
it
didn‚t
take
much
time
were
quite
enlightening
the

represent
a
gain
of
percentage
points
for
carson
since
the
last
nbcwall
street
journal
survey
in
midoctober
and
a

decline

the
results
were
evident
immediately
the
results
were
lower
and
lower
year
after
year
the
result
was
an
additional

the
result
was
a
rough
estimate
on
deaths
and
costs
to
society
based
on
a
certain
amount
of
pollution
triggering
each
death
the
result
was
smoke

the
review
found
langs
work
has
adhered

the

by
the
disclosure
that

departure

relied
exclusively
on

about

the

will
be
formally
announced
by

will
also
look
at
the
use
of

in
the
policymaking
process
the
revival
of
portrait
painting
the
reception
of
cubism
the
influence
of
primitivism
and
the
search
for
new
straightforward
motives
from
everyday
life
all
interacted
in
this
international
cultural
exchange
there
was
a
bigger
discrepancy
this
year
but
nevertheless
there
was
always
a
reduction
in
the
results
of
the
english
students
tremblay
said
there
was
a
comfort
for
these
people
in
knowing
what
to
expect
from
their
experience
from
their
meal
from
those
crazydelicious
desserts
there
was
a
coroners
inquest
into
the
shooting
deaths
in
mayerthorpe
he
said
there
was
a
discussion
but
it
was
not
on
the
record
and
therefore
i
will
not
divulge
the
content
of
that
discussion
he
said
there
was
a
large
crowd
‚
not
sold
out
but
busy
loud
and
decked
out
in
red
there
was
a
little
foyerporch
before
you
actually
got
inside
the
house
there
was
a
lot
of
push
from
community
to
do
another
production
and
this
is
a
result
of
that
there
was
also
a
debutant
in
the
fleet
side
lloyd
harrington
who
was
playing
his
first
competitive
game
for
the
club
since
joining
from
dover
in
summer
there
was
also
praise
for
germans
recycling
rates
which
at
percent
are
among
the
best
in
europe
there
was
an
even
greater
increase
in
awareness
that
breast
reconstruction
could
be
done
using
a
womans
own
fat
tissue
as
opposed
to
synthetic
breast
implants
the
researchers
found
there
was
an
expectation
that
i
would
be
england
manager
there
was
a
question
over
whether
the
trajectory
and
demand
for
wearables
in
the
apple
ecosystem
was
there
and
real
he
said
there
was
a
small
army
of
people
behind
the
counter
for
the
opening
reports
scott
lynch
who
was
on
the
scene
for
todays
debut
of
the
counter
service
section
of
the
restaurant
there
was
a
time
in
which
his
gate
was
fast
and
he
would
meet
the
children
half
way
up
the
street
there
was
a
very
heated
debate
van
zeller
acknowledges
there
was
bipartisan
support
in
so
why
the
commotion
over
a
similar
law
in
some
ask
there
was
dancing
in
the
streets
there
was
even
a
hint
of
jasmine
in
the
air
there
was
intense
pressure
to
produce
results
under
the
challenge
initiative
the
report
said
there
was
little
instruction
in
math
or
english
there
was
little
wind
and
the
oc
water
was
flat
on
a
oc
day
with
puffy
clouds
dotting
blue
skies
there
was
my
father
driving
my
mother
in
the
passenger
side
myself
my
sister
and
my
yearold
niece
in
the
back
there
was
no
appeal
from
watling
or
other
players
behind
the
wicket
but
boult
made
a
halfhearted
appeal
that
was
turned
down
by
the
field
umpire
there
was
no
claim
of
responsibility
but
the
proximity
to
syria
suggested
it
could
be
related
to
the
conflict
there
was
no
connection
to
the
mystery
drone
flights
over
the
past
two
days
the
spokeswoman
said
there
was
no
conversation‚
peskov
told
journalists
there
was
no
difference
in
cpr
performed
by
first
responders
or
ems
over
that
period
there
was
no
fog
that
day
there
was
no
government
confirmation
of
the
loss
of
territory
there
was
no
immediate
claim
of
responsibility
of
the
attack
there
was
no
immediate
kremlin
comment
on
his
odessa
appointment
but
andre
purgin
a
top
eastern
ukraine
separatist
leader
called
it
‚úmockery
and
an
absolutely
unprecedented
step‚
there
was
no
immediate
word
from
either
side
about
what
was
discussed
there
was
no
indication
that
was
connected
to
the
flags
there
was
no
sign
of
violence
but
sentiment
was
palpably
tense
with
one
migrant
holding
up
a
sign
saying
we
are
under
siege
there
was
nothing
more
i
could
have
done
in
terms
of
being
ready
to
play
and
it
gave
me
some
invaluable
oneonone
time
with
the
coaches
there
was
no
timetable
on
when
he
would
start
rehabilitation
or
when
he
would
return
there
was
of
course
a
backstage
area
but
not
a
vip
area
there
was
one
window
in
our
room
she
says
there
was
so
many
questions
i
still
had
and
i
thought
it
was
worth
exploring
further
there
was
stiff
competition
but
when
the
dust
settled
a
quartet
from
jonathan
grant
high
school
emerged
winners
in
the
junior
category
there
was
the
slow
clopping
of
a
horsedrawn
cart
there
was
worse
to
come
there
were
deaths
in
total
six
in
albertas

about
of
us
there
were
a
bunch
of
nearby
bars
and
everybody
left
them
and
wandered
over
to
the
zoo
there
were
all
sorts
of
different
ideas
pitched
over
the
past
three
years
said
abrams
‚úthere
were
also
no
physical
obstructions
present
on
the
road
there
were
also
reports
of
debris
in
the
water
at
the
same
site
there
were
children
and
women
among
them
he
said
there
were
complications
and
doctors
‚únearly
lost‚
both
of
them
in
the
process
kim
said
there
were
fewer
than
government
employees
when
he
arrived
there
were
intelligence
reports
of
the
shanty
town
being
used
as
an
underground
railway
and
stowaway
for
illegal
migrants
there
were
intensive
contacts
there
were
many
intimate
discussions
about
what
can
be
done
to
lessen
the
likelihood
that
people
will
choose
to
attempt
to
bring
an
end
to
their
own
lives
there
were
no
disruptions
inside
the
show
at
the
centre
in
the
square
in
kitchener
wednesday
and
the
crowd
applauded
cosby
as
he
took
the
stage
but
a
small
group
of
protesters
outside
the
venue
chanted
slogans
like
rape
is
not
funny
outside
there
were
no
government
officials
present
at
tuesdays
commemoration
there
were
no

and
only
minor

there
were
no
losses
among
the
military
there
were
no
reports
of
any
injuries
caused
by
the
tampered
candy
there
were
no
reports
of
serious
injuries
there
were
no
victims
in
the
helicopter
accident
in
djougou
mariececile
zinsou
who
is
also
a
member
of
her
fathers
communications
team
wrote
on
her
twitter
feed
there
were
numerous
sightings
in
the
days
immediately
following
including
her
in
various
locations
throughout
the
acre
park
along
the
west
bank
of
the
willamette
river
there
were
of
course
young
women
from
a
variety
of
backgrounds
but
at
least
one
category
wasnt
included
transgender
women
there
were
reports
we
received
that
the
deer
had
on
occasion
knocked
down
children
and
had
jumped
on
people
when
they
were
putting
canoes
in
the
river
etc
this
caused
concerns
for
serious
injury
or
worse
he
said
there
were
several
days
of
clashes
about
two
weeks
ago
muslim
protesters
barricaded
themselves
inside
the
mosque
while
hurling
stones
and
fireworks
at
police
there
were
sirens
going
constantly
a
few
stragglers
trying
and
failing
to
hail
cabs
plainclothes
riot
police
making
the
rounds
in
packs
of
wearing
jeans
and
helmets
and
bulletproof
vests
and
carrying
guns
as
long
as
my
arm
‚úthere
were
so
many
elderly
people
in
their
wheelchairs
with
foreign
caregivers
and
they
were
just
languishing
there
with
nothing
to
do‚
he
said
adding
that
he
thought
they
needed
activities
and
entertainment
there
were
so
many
people
involved
in
this
one
as
in
most
that
eventually
everyone
sort
of
became
like
one
big
blur
there
were
thin
metal
spikes
attached
to
the
windowsills
there
were
unconfirmed
reports
that
the
warehouse
contained
tonnes
of
sodium
cyanide
stored
in
wooden
boxes
or
iron
barrels
there
were
whispers
for
a
long
time
there
were
whistles
of
approval
as
he
tackled
the
issue
of
corruption
and
called
on
african
countries
to
end
the
bad
tradition
of
female
genital
mutilation
and
of
child
marriage
there
will
always
be
those
individuals
that
will
take
as
much
advantage
as
you
let
them
there
will
be
a
letter
from
the
foreign
ministry
to
the
relevant
parties
in
the
security
council
syrian
tourism
minister
bisher
yazagi
told
reuters
there
will
be
a
military
component
to
this
the
president
acknowledged
wednesday
there
will
be
excessive
overcrowding
so
tensions
are
sure
to
intensify
there
will
be
improvements
in
the
skills
of
community
teams
who
support
them
to
achieve
this
there
will
be
more
search
warrants
on
marijuana
dispensaries
at
some
point
said
palmer
but
it
is
still
not
going
to
be
the
no
priority
for
the
vancouver
police
department
there
will
be
multiple
appeals
gertner
said
there
will
be
no
shortage
of
hometown
competitions
there
will
be
records
at
this
fair
that
have
made
the
trek
from
as
far
away
as
georgia
there
will
be
some
prompts
on
the
screen
asking
you
for
one
to
verify
the
amount
of
the
transaction
there
will
be
some
unions
that
will
be
extremely
worried
about
jobs
and
trade
and
secretary
clinton
is
going
to
have
to
deal
with
that
there
will
however
be
one
hurdle
for
developers
there
wont
be
as
many
turkeys
as
last
year
but
a
shortage
means
you
cant
get
them
which
is
not
the
case
he
said
there
would
be
a
stringent
division
between
the
two
he
told
the
tv
station
there
you
are
stuck
in
traffic
as
you
try
to
get
on
the
bay
bridge
while
that
lane
sits
there
practically
empty
the
rhythm
section
of
dennis
and
bobbie
hackney
is
also
pretty
damn
good
and
when
it
all
comes
together
they
whip
up
a
mad
frenzy
of
punk
power
that
will
make
the
kids
cower
the
right
wants
more
money
for
the
military
the
left
wants
more
money
for
welfare
guns
and
butter
thats
what
we
are
going
to
have
guns
and
butter
but
as
a
consequence
i
think
they
are
destroying
the
country
by
adding
more
debt

at

located
near

the
rise
came
despite
anxiety
over
chinas
economic

powerful
enough
to
lift

about

experts

the

the

drew
harsh
criticism
from

republicans
who
accused
the

of
taking
on
the
role
of

the

focused

directed

users

thats
the
approach
we

these

somehow
the
analogy
seems
temporary

these

also
come
with

risk

is
not

to

then
together
they

that

unable

express

potentially
pollute

a
critical
source
of

they
still
deride

also
give
much
of

they
also
share
an
interest
in
a
return

they
differ
fundamentally
on
what
that

look
like

sometimes
hit

public
intoxication
and
possession
of

paraphernalia
they
attached
a
motor
to
each
boat
and
asked
who
wanted
to
be
captain
they
attribute
the
lapses
in
communication
inability
to
keep
track
of
suspected
militants
and
failure
to
act
on
intelligence
to
a
lack
of

in
some

and
a

in
the

he
was
given
an
honorary

plus
a

of

they
can
get
on
a

and
go
to
a
place
that
is
very
much
unlike
where
they
live
and
do
something
positive
they
can
have
a
direct
impact
on
how
you
save
in
a
roth
ira
or
k
vs
a
traditional

as

as

nothing
said
harbin
who
also
served
as
marylands
mental
health
director
before
becoming
a
consultant
they
can
not
decide
if
they
are
unhappy
with
what
they
have
and
do
anything
about
it
they
can
not
form
unions
and
this
goes
back
to
the
new
deal
of
the
s
they
cant
continue
to
harvest
data
they
cant
even
bring
themselves
to
criticize
a
child
molester
who
protected
other
child
molesters
solely
because
hes
a
republican
they
cant
stop

with

they

show
no

asked
and
buy
a

they
chalked

of

they
cling
to
the
hope
that
the
killing
of
kenji

doesnt
necessarily
have
direct
immediate
implications
for
the
safety
of
the
young
pilot
they
come
from
the
lorri

and
show

down

they
come
right
out
and
punch
you
in

section
they
comfortably
sealed
the
league
title
early
on
and
made
the
semifinals
of
the
german
cup
and
the
champions
league
they
complain
of
complex
systems
for
oncesimple
tasks
like
turning
on
the
light
‚úlearning
algorithms‚
that
get
their
preferences
wrong
and
systems
that
simply
go
on
the
fritz
too
often
they
considered
it
they
controlled
the
match
in
the
second
half
and
lex
sealed
the
with
a
goal
in
the
th
minute
they
could
be
stuck
here
for
two
three
days
they
could
change
the
eu
treaties
but
that
is
a
very
difficult
process
with
all
sorts
of
bear
traps
including
referendums
in
some
member
states
they
could
have
gone
the
surrogate
route
but
were
moved
by
the
fact
there
are
kids
in
the
foster
system
without
homes
they
could
mount
the
argument
that
the
threat
from
isis
to
australian
interests
is
greater
than
that
from
the
saaf
in
deir
azzour
or
hassakeh
and
they
will
therefore
target
isis
regardless
they
could
shut
down
public
schools
or
threaten
to
do
so
like
new
jerseys
supreme
court
did
in
after
lawmakers
failed
to
put
enough
money
into

they
could
use
the
greek
election
as
an
excuse
to
make

said
they
definitely
look
better

did
dr
kevin
willetts
said
in
september
they
demand
a
higher
level
of
public
scrutiny
as
well
as
a
careful
evaluation
of
the
officers
conduct
and
whether
under
law
those
actions
were
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
they
determined
that
the
more
a
tissues
cells
divide
the
higher
the
chance
cancer
could
develop
in
that
tissue
they
detonated
about
kilograms
of
dynamite
inside
a
meterdeep
hole
dug
on
the
mountain
side
theyd
have
to
register
within
six
months
he
said
they
did
a
really
great
job‚
they
did
it
at
a
time
when
we
have
minimized
the
guards
around
the
compound
because
they
were
sent
to
a
battle
he
said
they
didnt
often
surface
and
speak
and
if
they
did
then
everybody
had
to
hold
their
breath
while
direction
finding
stations
around
the
country
tried
to
get
a
fix
on
that
uboat
she
said
they
did
this
all
night
a
ukrainian
soldier
named
andrei
said
thursday
after
fleeing
debaltseve
they
died
in
accomplishing
their
mission
with
courage
with
bravery
with
dignity
they
die
down
at
the
festival
site
as
sundown
nears
but
that
doesnt
mean
the
partys
over
they
discussed
it
over
breakfast
and
with
rep
lewis
of
atlanta
they
divide
the
city
into
two
and
duarte
tries
to
remove
memories
of
amelia
from
his
life
by
cutting
her
name
out
of
his
vast
book
collection
theyd
lost
touch
a
few
years
ago
but
reconnected
in
recent
months
meek
said
adding
that
there
were
things
about
roofs
recent
behavior
that
scared
him
they
do
not
in
any
way
attempt
to
diminish
their
dignity
he
said
of
the
attitudes
held
by
staff
and
administrators
at
pearson
they
do
not
yet
have
that
capability
they
dont
believe
god
wanted
a
man
to
pick
up
a
gun
and
start
this
shooting
they
dont
inflict
much
pain
on
the
regime
and
actually
benefit
the
hardliners
who
control
the
few
gateways
in
and
out
of
the
economy
they
dont
know
that
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
are
living
lifestyles
that
put
lots
of
carbon
into
the
air
at
their
expense
they
dont
need
that
social
security
check
they
dont
really
understand
what
it
means
to
live
in
europe
as
an
illegal
immigrant
and
what
the
consequences
are
they
dont
speak
any
languages
but
now
they
say
they
are
going
to
holland
too
they
dont
want
to
see
kooky
archetype
films
about
getting
older
they
dressed
and
moved
like
commandos
the
year
also
brought
occasions
to
celebrate
the
years
immediately
preceding
the
stockmarket
crash
were
a
remarkably
productive
period
for

the

measles
outbreak
has
been
traced
to
disneyland
in

california
where

were
exposed
to
the

in

they
embraced
me
as
a
little

they
enslave

and
force
women
into

they
estimated
he
was
to

above
the

they
estimate
hed
been
in
the

about
minutes
they
estimate
the
mammoth
likely
lived
to
years
ago
but
the
remains
still
have
to
be
dated
fisher
said
they
face
circumcision
they
fear
that
by
seeking
additional
us
military
support
ghani
is
sending
the
wrong
message
to
the
taliban
which
was
ousted
in
an
americanled
operation
in
and
is
fighting
to
return
to
power
and
impose
a
strict
interpretation
of
sharia
they
feel
especially
aggrieved
because
after
hungary
built
a
razorwire
fence
on
its
border
with
serbia
the
flood
of
migrants
switched
into
croatia
which
then
adopted
controls
of
its
own
isolating
slovenia
they
finally
finished
recording
sessions
last
week
they
fled
when
ground
troops
arrived
they
flounder
in
infighting
and
when
they
do
get
something
done
it
is
a
patchwork
of
add
ons
they
forced
a
scrum
and
in
injury
time
jamie
roberts
straightened
the
attack
and
biggar
was
perfectly
set
up
to
land
a
dropped
goal
for
a
lead
at
halftime
they
forced
down
the
bedroom
door
before
they
were
attacked
by
the
man
and
by
this
point
the
flames
had
reached
waist
height
they
found
him
and
determined
he
also
needed
to
be
transported
to
hospital
they
found
the
f
necrophorum
bacteria
in
percent
of
patients
with
sore
throat
symptoms
and
about
percent
of
those
without
sore
throats
they
found
wearable
devices
in
general
were
less
accurate
than
the
smartphone
apps
they
fully
understand
at
that
age
even
the
sacrifices
that
were
made
said
hayes
they
give
harrowing
testimony
to
what
many
have
long
tried
to
raise
awareness
about
they
give
unconditional
love
in
its
purest
form
mosher
said
they
go
right
to
the
heart
of
people
who
wish
for
longlasting
peace
and
for
a
ban
on
nuclear
weapons
she
said
they
got
biologists
involved
and
it
was
decided
that
the
lizards
would
need
to
be
resettled
after
their
hibernation
period
before
the
excavators
could
start
rumbling
they
got
that
way
from
paying
your
bills
cleaning
your
clothes
and
listening
to
you
talk
about
how
cool
you
are
they
go
under
the
leaves
and
you
can
hear
them
catch
prey
‚
its
a
little
snap
‚
but
you
cant
see
them
sorger
explained
they
grabbed
one
of
the
attackers
from
his
neck
and
he
couldnt
detonate
his
explosives
and
he
was
shot
and
killed
durrani

themselves
they
had
taken
a
lead
into
the
ninth
inning
with
their
ace
on
the
mound
and
champagne
on

in
the
clubhouse
they
had
to
hire
more

to
actually
bring
the
products
to
your
door
but
the
products
are
already
being
stored
in
a

in
the
community
they
have
also
cobbled
together
a
matchingdonation
scheme
of
up

a
long
way
‚úthey
have
lost
a

they
have
no

they
have
not
released
a
description

they
havent
taken
the

they
have
started
reviewing
the
implementation
process
he
said
they
have
though
set
up
super
pacs
and
this
has
dramatically
changed
politics
they
have
too
much
money
invested
they
have
to
pay
what
they
owe
but
always
have
many
chances
to
do
so
before
they
get
evicted
he
said
in
an
email
they
have
to
sit
in
those
positions
they
have
to
take
hundreds
of
steps
like
this
one
just
to
trade
their
old
lives
for
new

they
hope
to
expand
the

eventually
to

the

huddled
together
behind

underneath

hung
in
there

make
it
absolutely
an
imperative

not

in
the

they
managed
this
year
to
preserve
most
of
the
past

it
by

may
hope
to
catch
attention
and
get
more
momentum
they
may
well
yet
move
toward
us
they
might
be
more
susceptible
to
certain
diseases
later
in
life
according
to
a
new
study
they
might
choose
to
keep
quiet
so
they
can
keep
their
job
they
might
do
well
by
not
hiring

hammerwielding
nutjobs

overly
aggressive

be

such
as
ebola

need
to
look
at
the
positive
outcome

on
the
platform
they
say
after
strangling
her
she
grabbed
his
gun
and
shot
him
once
they
say
a
possible
motive
was
anger
and
frustration
over
his
struggles
to
work
and
communicate
with
other
researchers
a
competitive
neuroscience
program
they

he
ran
off

hit
a

i
still
got
my
noggin
so
im
happy
campbell
said
they
say
it
will
also
give
business
groups
a
disproportionate
influence
over
new

and
therefore
they
argue
it
is
undemocratic
they
say
life
is
returning
to
normal
with
roads
open
enabling
deliveries
of
food
and
medicine
they
say
the
blues
have
too
many
players
of
quality
and
experience
to
go
much
longer
without
a
win
and
fear
they
could
be
the
team
that
allows
the
blues
to
break
a
winning
drought
that
stretches
to
nine
matches
including
the
last
two
games

thursday
they
scored
from
a
freekick
and
then
it
was
halftime
they
searched
his
car
and
found
the
machete
and
throwing
knife
they
seemed
like
they
were
just
a
little
sharper
a
little
crisper
a
little
bit
more
on
their
toes
early
and
it
seemed
to
take
us
a
while
to
get
going
they
seemed
really
adamant
that
we
are
going
to
come
and
arrest
you
if
you
dont
take
care
of
this
said
ireton
relaying
the

fronts
simultaneously
zakharchenko
said
they
seem
pretty
shocked
when
you
walk
up

what
theyre
getting
justin
bird
said
with
a
laugh
they
seem
to
be
fairly
skinny
and
maybe
out
of
sympathy
trying
to
feed
them
cluff
says
they
seem
to
yearn
for
acceptance
as
a
normal
nation
and
that
would
confer
it
they
served
as
redmayne‚s
foundation
for
understanding
a
little
of
the
world
when
gender
transition
was
less
common
they
share
carreys
attitude
that
vaccines
are
the
work
of
greedy
corporations
and
politicians
an
apparatus
more
interested
in
making
money
than
safe
products
they
should
be
clear
that
they
aim
to
stigmatize
the
organizations
like
fossilfuel
companies
that
are
being
invested
in
not
those
that
do
the
investing
like
universities
pension
funds
or
foundations
they
should
get
raises
they
should
look
like
a
fabulous
freshlypicked
bunch
of
flowers
that
you
happen
to
be
wearing
on
your
head
they
should
proceed‚
they
show
how
the
pain
from
the
slump
in
the
oilbyrail
industry
has
spread
far
and
wide
they
simply
have
not
been
able
to
make
a
clutch

they
speak
an
old
version
of
the
turkish
language
called
the
turkmen
language
they
spent
an
extra
month
in
space
after
their
return
was
delayed
following
the
failure
of
a
rocket
delivering
supplies
they
spent
two
hours
there
that
night
before
using
trolleys
to
wheel
the
two
servers
past
the
thirdfloor
security
desk
into
a
lift
and
out
of
the
building
they
stuck
to
the
partys
narrative
even
when
confronting
the
not
ready
line
with
trudeau
saying
he
was
not
ready
to
watch
hardworking
canadians
lose
jobs
and
fall
further
behind
they
succeed
big
time
in
the
specs
department
they
suspect
arthur
may
have
altered
the
note
after
receiving
her
mothers
signature
they
swung
the
ball
nicely
and
bowled
good
areas
but
our
shot
selection
was
very
poor
and
our
defense
more
than
anything
else
was
an
area
that
was
a
lot
poorer
than
we
would
have
liked
clarke
said
they
take
our
natural
resources
and
what
are
their
obligations‚
he
said
they
take
reservations
or
call
for
exact
hours
due
to
weather
at
they
talk
to
don
hewitt
producer
of
the
cbs
show
minutes
they
teach
us
things
we
do
not
know
we
learned
from
seeing
that
this
girl
is
tough
that
she
has
been
through
a
lot
of
trouble
and
come
out
of
it
still
capable
with
the
resilience
of
childhood
they
tell
you
dont
camp
anywhere
you
see
some
bear
activities
they
tend
to
be
adept
at
killing
new
ideas
and
excitement
for
innovation
they
then
appear
to
begin
pounding
him
they
then
reinvest
profits
in
creating
new
companies
to
exploit
different
opportunities
they
think
its
just
fabulous
but
its
not
they
thought
he
must
be
beyond
saving
when
he
suddenly
came
to
and
frantically
pulled
one
of
them
close
they
threw
for
but
did
so
averaging
a
seasonhigh
yards
per
pass
as
wilson
hit
on
of
attempts
they
told
us
to
take
a
train
to
calais
and
then
the
ferry
and
thats
what
were
going
to
do
he
said
slinging
his
rackets
over
his
shoulder
they
told
us
wait
the
doctor
is
coming
now
but
the
child
was
almost
dying
in
our
arms
they
took
advantage
of
it
they

games
with
a
home

coming
up
against

stronger

used
to
be
very
easy
to
negotiate
with

times
have
changed
they
used
to
put
french
chalk
down
and
where
people
had
been
backwards
and
forwards
over
it
it
would
turn
black
theyve
adapted
to
cold
winters
but
move
slowly
which
is
the
only
silver
lining

already
got
more
than

been
saving
up
diligently
since
theyve
called
in
all
their
employees
made
it
an
allhandsondeck
kind
of
situation
so
were
ready
they‚ve
dismissed
the
dowsers‚
occasional
success
as
the
equivalent
of
a
fortunate
roll
of
the
dice
‚
nothing
but
pure
simple
luck
theyve
even
taken
payment
in
kind
with
a
running
bar
tab
theyve
had
a
couple
decades
of
down
years
and
its
pretty
exciting
to
have
a
winner
theyve
heard
directly
from
jay
z
and
timbaland
who
explained
how
big
pimpin
came
together
and
why
they
believe
they
have
the
right
to
use
the
khosara
khosara
notes
theyve
helped
forge
the
identity
of
this
place
and
to
me
they
help
explain
why
so
many
people
on
the
reservation
wont
consider
coal
development
theyve
hurt
people
that
cant
afford
to
be
hurt
theyve
made
a
new
floor
from
barn
siding
sourced
near
carlsons

at

early
tuesday
they
were
accused
of
setting
up
an

room
to
prepare
attacks
against
the
state
in
the
weeks
after
the
army
ousted
islamist
president
mohamed
morsi
in

they
were
all
telling
me
like
hey
your

here
yelich
recalled
they
were
all
trying
to
take
pictures
on
their

and
were
waving

were
almost

to
dig
up
our

here
‚
the
big
machine
was
knocking
down
small
growth
and
thats
sacred
they
were
also
the
result
of
lack
of
concern
for
what
may
go
wrong
he
wrote
they
were
angry
because
the
government
wants
to
tighten
the
system
still
further
by
penalising
radio
stations
if
they
just
keep
playing
the
same
french
hits
over
and
again
in

to
fulfil
their
quota
obligation
they
were
being

they

everybody
else
they

of

they
were
not
unanimous
however
on

they

really
getting

anything

thats
where
the
passion
came
from
into
the
tree
said
jones
they
were
throwing
drawers
open
and
moving
through
the
house
he
said
they
were
understandably
emotional
and
upset
by
some
of
the

that
they
heard
and
some
of

combined
with
the

provide

they
did

said
they
would
pay

the

would

from

think
again
today
the
company
quietly
announced
paragon
but
truth
be
told
we
know
almost
nothing
about
the
new
title
think
of
all
the
instagram
possibilities
think
of
all
the
ramifications
of
a
person
not
feeling
good
about
themselves
and
the
selfdestructive
behaviors
that
can
result
think
of
it
as
a
combination
of
a
great
rainy
day
fund
and
extra
money
to
invest
think
of
it
as
the
farming
equivalent
of
face
tagging
think
of
the
app
as
a
mix
of
periscope
and

yes
there
are
plenty
of
ways
to
stream
your

and
your

to

but
with

youre
not

think
super

rising

mass
extinctions

acidifying

think
this
wont

is
so
rare
as

not

hundreds

were
stuck

were
the
most
important
accessory
third
and
finally
i
recognize
that
while
the
dialogue
in

purports
to
address
ethics
it
is
inevitably
as
much
about
competing
ideologies
third
and
most

of

thirtythree

have
resigned
this

thirty

is
enough
this
accounts
for
the
cost
to
the
emergency

the

and
the
loss
of
the

the

would
otherwise

this

he
was
quoted
as
saying
by

this

which
has
returned
to
the

is
one
to
watch
it
could
have
widespread
implications
for
fake
stashhouse
cases
and
the

this
certainly
puts
a
new
spin
on
some
words
he
shared
with

in

he
said
im
growing

this

thank
you
this
changes
everything
this

is
gone
this
comes
after

ont
shot

killed

that
was
roaming

this
congress
also
led
to
the

conference
against

in
durban
south
africa
this
consideration
helped
when
for
example
the
text
discussed
women
in
a
way
that
made
me
uncomfortable
this
contrasts
to
greece
which
remains
in
its
euimf
program
almost
five
years
and
two
bailouts
after
it
had
to
seek
international
help
this
could
be

optimistic
this
could
be

sides
this
has
been

very
great
learning
experience
for
me
this
has
been
my
main
focus
getting
back
getting
prepared
and
then
coming
here
for
this
he
said
this
has
been
tremendously
upsetting
for
landowners
in
this
process
and
the
fact
that
political
leaders
have
just
tried
to
kick
our
butts
along
with
transcanada
has
been
tremendously
disappointing
said
thompson
this
has
caused
protest
from
ngos
who
say
its
hypocritical
to
seek
sponsorship
from
oil
and
construction
companies
whose

model
depends

this
has
given
me
the
opportunity
to
appreciate
what
my
father
took
pride
in
teaching
me
about
the
fields
this
has
gone
from
aiding
and
abetting
to
him
being
labeled
a
killer
nunez
said
of
his

this
has
made
me
realize
that
our
time
of
innocence
is
over
this
has
not
remained
unaddressed
either
this
has
repercussions
in
the
long
term
this
heartbreaking
incident
will
impact
many
of
our
fellow

i
ask
all
arizonans
to
keep
them

the

of
the
individual
lost
in
their
thoughts
and
prayers
as
they
cope

feldman
said
this
is
a
great
opportunity
for

the
truth

we
are
going

do
it
‚úthis
is
a
historic
day
in

the

has
finally
corrected

she
said
in

this
is
also
an
opportunity
for

potluck
to
share
the

feast
this
is
also
a
value
which
is
fundamental
for

because
by

it
is
with

an
adaptive
change

to
sustain
the
increased

this
is
a
new
surge
says
sergei
kuznetsov
this
is
an
extremely
manageable
amount
for
a
country
as
large
as
the
united
states
which
had
planned
to
resettle
refugees
this
year
as
part
of
its
regular
refugee
program
before
the
global
refugee
crisis
hit
the

this
is
an
incident
weve
never

this

a
seattle
team
that

learned
how
to
amp
up
its

prodigious
intensity
in
the

this
is
a
serious
thing
this
is
a
small
impact
this
is
a
speed
bump
in
terms
of
the
total
return
that
we
expect
from
this
flyby
this
is
a
substantial
drop
in
support
since
the
last
parliamentary
election
in
and
a
dramatic
change
in
fortunes
since
erdogan

elected

im
afraid
this
is
bad
stuff
this
is
beauty
and
health
antiaging
from
the
inside
out
this
is
because
a
huge
proportion
of
the
nations
population
is
concentrated
in
the
capital
as
many
mongolians
see
low
economic
prospects
elsewhere
in

this
is
because

ellspermann
believes
something
needs
to
be
done
to
change
this
‚úthis
is
being
done
countrywide

it

a
clear
admission
that
the
resettled

lack
the
means
or
funding
to
fully
utilise
the
land‚
olivier
said
this
is
dangerous
behaviour
this
is
different
from
a
pregame
lockerroom
prayer
where
attendance
is
mandatory
this
is
done
with
the
help
of
syria
this
is
especially
so
in
the
social

age
as
once
private
political
opinions
become
public
at
lightning
speed

exactly
whats
threatening

ultraorthodox
said
mordechai
goldman
a
consultant
on
ultraorthodox
issues
and
analyst
for
the
almonitor
website
this
is
extraordinarily
valuable
and
it‚s
a
type
of
care
that
doctors
can
not
provide
this
is
far
from
the
first
time
the
syrian
electronic
army
has
launched
a
political
cyberattack
against
wellknown
targets
this
is
for
the
big
boys‚
this
is
for
two
reasons
this
is
highly
experimental
treatment
and
we
dont
know
yet
whether
its
of
benefit
to
her
this
is
his
last
producorial
way
of
screwing
me
over
that
on
my

i
have
to
go
to

this
is
his
second
attempt
this
is
history
said
rebecca
ostrega
a

this
is
just
another
salvo
in
what
will
be
an
extended
battle
for
ridesharing
companies
trying
to
maintain
business
models
that
keep
all
drivers
as
independent
contractors
this
is
known
to
many
of
us
but
we
had
better
keep
it
in
the
forefronts
of
our
minds
this
is

‚úthis

that
italy

wanted

‚úthis
is
not

for

in

this
is
not
an

thing
to
do
as
employees
are
often
eager
to
please
those
above
them
and
dont
want
to
criticize
or
question
their
higherups
this
is
not
an
issue
only
facing
the
university
of
missouri
but
a
fundamental
human
rights
issue
this
is
not
a
shy
movie
this
is
not
canada
and
the
kind
of
leadership
and
divisive
politics
that
he‚s
playing
is
dangerous
and
irresponsible‚
this
is
not
just
bad
for
families
but
bad
for
our
economy
which
to
a
large
extent
is
driven
by
consumer

denigrate

predominately

said

the

oohed
this
is
the
opportunity
the

she
said
this

the

that

hasell
said
adding
she
wished
that

some
point
clarifying

this
is
the

bad‚
this
is
the
result
of
a
lax

and
the
mosqueization
of
france
a

standard

said
this
is
the
result
of

reversed

that
allows

this

much
for
anyone

bear
this
is
true
of

which
is
open

by

this
is
typical
of
the
downward

this
is
unlikely
but
their

is
understandable
this
is
what
awaits

like
these

many

tajiks
hazaras

is
what

says
mr

this
is
where

he
said
this
is
where
the

first
cities

where

were

developed
more
than

this

this

indicates
the
detachment
of

from

a
willingness

this

as

paris
ap
french
president
says
he
will
declare
state
of
emergency
and
close
borders
this
may
also
be
a
factor
for
some
jihadists
who
fought
in
syria
and
iraq
at
least
in
the
early
stages
of
the
war
when
jihadists
did
not
commit
the
atrocities
that
islamic
state
is
has
become
known
for
this
may
be
pointing
to
a
volcanolike
origin
of
the
spots
but
we
will
have
to
wait
for
better
resolution
before
we
can
make
such
geologic
interpretations
chris
russell
from
the
dawn
mission
said
this
may
be
true
this
may
seem
incongruous
for
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
represents
itself
as
the
guardian
of
social
standards
against
western
decadence
this
may
well
be
true
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
a
lot
of
british
muslims
want
to
bring
back
stoning
amputations
and
beheadings
this
mean
higher
production
cost
companies
will
slowly
leave
the
market
right
this
means
all
official
signs
and
announcements
must
be
written
in
english
while
all
government
officials
including
police
and
immigration
officials
must
be
able
to
communicate
in
english
this
means
hundreds
of
people
without
homes
have
lost
regular
access
to
breakfast
and
dinner
meals
and
to
sanitation
facilities
including
restrooms
and
showers
this
means
only
small
bags
or
clear
bags
are
acceptable
this
means
that
as
the
economy
grows
state
revenues
grow
more
slowly
this
means
that
in
areas
with
limited
mobile
connectivity
updates
to
the
records
will
subsequently
be
synced
with
the
central
database
once
internet
connectivity
returns
this
means
that
purging
the
use
of
the
nword
from
all
american
discourse
aside
from
being
a
baldly
racist
double
standard
would
not
accomplish
anything
whatsoever
towards
the
cause
of
racial
justice
or
harmony
this
means
that
there
are
many
brands
out
there
that
do
not
have
any
problems
this
means
there
are
now
more
antiestablishment
votes
for
the
taking
than
establishment
ones
this
means
the
right
to
impose
restrictions
on
the
freedom
of
movement
of
eu
citizens
through
visa
controls
this
means
the
supersonic
parachute
will
have
to
create
sufficient
atmospheric
drag
to
slow
the
vehicles
down
so
they
can
be
landed
safely
this
meant
that
his

included
nonverbal
children
with
downs
syndrome

intellectual
disability

this

suicide
involving

persons
this
was
a
pleasant
side
effect

not
a
goal
this
was
a
really
absurd
situation
this
was
a
serious

given
the

by

campbell

this

true
for

this

last

on

in

of

this
was
just
a
few

died
jennifer
lawrence
says
this
was
just
the
latest
in
a
series
of
such
incidents
to
hit
the
us
this
was
more
like
david
lynch
seahawks
with
left
‚úthis
was
not
a
cut
by
congress
this
was
not
domestic
violence
for
many
reasons
including
the
fact
that
the
woman
with
the
knife
is
not
in
a
relationship
with
mr
galette
nor
do
they
live

this

this
was
one
tired
team
and
for
good
reason
this
was
probably
not
accidental
this
was
the
advice
a
colleague
offered
when
i
told
him
what
i
was
facing
this
was
the

clearly

‚
if

he
said
this

wetter

‚úthis
will
help
to
establish
a
common
denominator
between
patients
and
surgeons
which
might
ultimately
lead
to
higher
patient
satisfaction‚
this
will
hurt
low

folks
because
they
spend
a
larger
portion
of
their

on
nondiscretionary
things
like
fuel
to
get

heating
their

they

this

money
said
dr
tom
ellman
a
director
at

without

in
southern
africa
this
will
not
be
tolerated
especially
by
those
on

who
are
drunk
on

others
money
this
will
of
course
come
as
a
disappointment
to
ukrainian

gave
a

for
me
to

in

way
this

continue
as
the
health
and
safety
of
our
players
remains
our
highest
priority
the
statement
concluded
this
would
be
both
scientifically
and
ethically
preferable
said
lang
since
if
a
trial
has
to
be
stopped
because
it
runs
out
of
participants
with
the
relevant
disease
then
everyone
who
has
taken
part
until
then
has
run
a
needless
risk
this
would
effectively
all
but
eliminate
refugee
immigration
from
those
two
countries
by
creating
significant
and
perhaps
unclearable
hurdles
for
the
agencies
in
charge
of
overseeing
admission
to
the
united
states
this
would
further
increase
the
risks
for
renzi
because
his
senate
majority
is
much
slimmer
this
would
help
to
protect
and
possibly
even
improve
the
soil
preventing
a
dry
spell
from
becoming
a
disastrous
drought
this
would
not
have
been
unusual
as
gliniewicz
was
the
type
of
officer
who
considered
himself
onduty
as
soon
as

said

we

take

they
do
so
with

full

there
can
be
no
room
for
hesitation
when

are
at

source
told

we
must
not
allow
ourselves
to
be
provoked
says
demirtas
we
must
realize
ladies

gentlemen
that
the
best
investment
a

can
make
is
investment
in
its
own
people
thereby
helping
to
facilitate
the
sustained
development
and
heightened
human
development
measures
for
its
citizenry
we
must
resolve
now
to
live
as
nobly
and
as
justly
as
possible
as
we
educate
new
generations
not
to
turn
their
back
on
our
neighbors
and
everything
around
us

said
we
must
resolve
to
find
a
vocabulary
for

that
allows
us
to
seek

without
intemperance
rancor
or
unnecessary
divisiveness
we
must
use
this
moment
to
recommit
ourselves
to
do
all
we
can
to
finish
this
work

year
ago
when

when
there
was
the

we
needed

doesnt

what

solving

innovative

see

still
would
have
gotten
the

better

tell

if
you

youre
primarily
talking
to
the

you
have
to
change
that
he
said
we
tend
to
assume
that
males
are
the
naturalized
victims
of
violence
and
we
really
only
pay
attention

have
our

aroused

its

from

as

were
clearly

very
disappointed

this
came
out

tried
something

merging
it
with

done
a
much
better

now

catching
them

making
sure

are
ok

back
then
to

lesson
if

maybe
google
it
before
calling
the

we
worked

to
have
succeeded
is
a
great
achievement
‚úwe
worked
in

summer
and
had
a
pretty
good
couple

weeks
but
we
didn‚t

would
all
be
doing
ourselves

quickly

i
cant
make

long
it
will

complains
the

what
exactly
is
common
core
what
few
seem
to
be
saying
amid
all
this
is
that
the
motives
of
two
criminals
who
are
muslims
should
not
be
imputed
to
millions
of
other
americans
who
happen
to
have
the

religious
faith
what
folks
have
found
at

point
is
that
if
you
have
immediate
intervention

support

the
psychological
impact
can
be
lessened
significantly
macy
said
what
followed
was
months
of
lightheadedness
and
lethargy
that
doctors
were
initially
unable
to
diagnose
what
follows
is
a
conversation
with
cnnmoneys
laurie
segall
and
two
of
the
purported
hackers
in
which
they
disguised
their
voices
what
future
for
the
new
ukraine
what
gets
perhaps
the
most
dicey
many
parents
say
is
when
you
are
in
a
public
setting
and
you
are
faced
with
whether
to
discipline
the
child
of
someone
you
dont
know
what
gets
said
is
‚òwe
shouldnt
have
this
mishmosh
of
different
laws
we
want
a
state
standard
and
the
state
standard
should
be
nothing‚

says
what
had
initially
appeared
to
be
a
sure
thing
for
the
incumbent
changed
when
a
former
ally
threw
his
hat
into
the
ring
what
happened
after
that
remains
a
bit
of
a
question
mark
for
the
time
being
what
happened
that
day
at
lilly
is
reverberating
throughout
the
company
with
executives
redoubling
their
efforts
and
employees
gaining
an
ability
to
bring
their
authentic
selves
to
the
workplace
what
happens
is
youre
given
an
audition
time
and
you
show
up
with
probably
about
other
hopefuls
what
happens
when
she
falls
off
her
horse
what
he
does
next
will
likely
be
the
difference
between
him
being
one
of
the
greatest
players
or
just
one
that
won
germany
the
world
cup
what
he
says
goes
what
if
he
ends
up
with
nine
or
home
runs
this
october
and
november
and
the
mets
win
the
the

what
if
i
didn‚t
flinch
every
time
someone
told
me
her
wedding‚s
going
to
be
in
the
fall
what
if
its
a
good
price
for
two
but
not
one
what
if
the

found
that

routinely
violated
the

what
im
doing
is
a
grey

said
a

who
goes

what
im
looking
for
is
some
kind
of
leadership
to
come
out
of
this
to
say
this
is
what
we
want
what
impulse
compelled
him
to
that
mosque

what
ipos
should
we
look

the
number
of
people
who
visited

from

dropped
by

what

the

what
is

what

what
is
two

what
is
your
proposal
for
guaranteeing
that
crowds
of
people
above
wont
compromise
the
structure
what
it
really
comes
down
to
is
the
candidates
want
to
have
more
control
of
the
ability
to
negotiate
with
the
networks
donald
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
said
after
the
meeting
what
it
takes
for
guys
to
be
good
is
to
be
constantly
reminded
of
the
principles
and
values
of
the
fraternities
to
which
they
pledge
themselves
harper
said
what
i
was
really
referring
to
is
the
flight
director
gene
kranzs
comment
that
this
will
be
our
finest
hour
what
keeps
me
up
at
night
are
the
ones
weve
missed
what
kind
of
effects
does
this
have
what
kind
of
instructions
would
she
give
to
the
justice
department
about
how
it
operates
in
states
where
marijuana
has
been
legalized
what
kind
of
options
are
those‚
what
led
to
this
what
lemon
laws
are
on
the
books
in
canada
what
made
it
more
difficult
was
that
centerfielder
roman
quinn
suffered
a
left
quadriceps
strain
during
his
second
atbat
on
friday
leaving
the
outfield
thinner
what
makes
the
venue
different
is
its
connection
to
stolo
history
what
matters
is
that
your
doctor
who
cares
about
you
is
happy
with
your
health
what
matters
more
what
not
to
say
to
a
transgender
person
espn
says
jenner
will
receive
the
arthur
ashe
award
at
its
espys
awards
show
july
in
los
angeles
what
our
study
shows
is
that
its
feasible
and
that
people
wont
smoke
more
regular
cigarettes
to
compensate
he
said
advertisement
results
are

the
new
england
journal
of

what
problem
do
they
have
that
it
would
solve
what
risks
to
the
organisation
did
you
see
in
the
video
what
salesforce
is
trying
to
do
is
position
its
service
cloud
for
the
day
when
mobile
applications
are
the
primary
service
vehicle
whats
devastating
for
comedy
central
is
that
its
forward
thinking
might
have
found
the
right
man
for
the
future
but
it
operates
in
the
present
in
a
model
not
built
for
the
audience
of
the
future
whats
driving
their
use
is
avoiding
the
withdrawal
trying
not
to
be
sick
its
not
about
getting
high
anymore
said
mcentegart
whats
ea
doing
about
that
what‚s
even
more
impressive
is
that
cokelaere
was
able
to
perform
this
feat
while
he
was
chained
to
a
tree
what‚s
even
more
surprising
though
is
that
such
an
accomplished
short
album
could
come
out
of
a
group
that
was
just
formed
this
year
whats
going
on
then
what
should
i
do
whats
in
store
for
china
in
whats
interesting
is
that
the
high
level
summaries
can
apply
to
many
films
but
the
great
ones
are
the
ones
who
told
their
stories
well
what‚s
more
apple
is
reportedly
toying
with
the
idea
of
expanding
the
range
of
iphone
color
options
with
a
pink
model
what‚s
more
if
the
undigested
proteins
enter
the
small
intestine
they‚ll
begin
to
putrefy
and
cause
gas
whats
more
likely
is
that
it
was
done
either
mistakenly
by
prorussian
separatists
or
by
design
by
antirussian
forces
seeking
a
macabre
propaganda
boost
what‚s
more

turned
into
a
full

job
for
patrick

who
saw

decided
to
make

whats
that
you
ask
what
still
matters
is
relationships
‚ò‚òwhat
struck
me
the
most
was
how
blatant
and
out
in

open
some
of

discrimination
was‚‚

what
they
found
was
a
yearold

and
his
yearold
wife
both
pointing
guns
at
yearold
aaron
lujan
what
they
have
in
common
are
protagonists
who
are
so
alienating
within
minutes
if
not
seconds
of
their
appearance
that
it
takes
a
strenuous
effort
at
suspending
disbelief
to
continue
watching
their
extended
shenanigans
what
they
were
concerned
about
was
that
when
palau
does
something
the
other
islands
often
follow
what
this
shows
is
that
the
pnp
supporters
are
a
little
more
eager
because
they
believe
they
have
the
momentum
what
was
a
slightly
plump

at

ballooned

what
was
it
like
working
professionally
alongside
your
fianc√
easier
or
harder
due
to
your
connection
‚úwhat
was
surprising
was
that
risk
was
high
for
many
different
psychiatric
disorders‚
which
may
mean
that
applying
the
results
of
adult
studies
to
kids
is
too
simplistic
she
told
reuters
health
by
email
what
was
the
plan
then
what
was
very
clear
from
the
meetings
with
the
players
was
their
desire
and
enthusiasm
about
making
this
the
greatest
fifa
womens
world
cup
ever
and
to
ensure
that
they
have
the
best
possible
conditions
to
perform
well
what
we
achieve
can
be
surprising
and
important
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
real
attempt
at
demographic
change
coupled
with
blatant
abuses
sunni
politician
hamed
almutlaq
told
the
associated
press
what
we
did
say
is
a
regime
change
in
syria
could
become
a
local
or
even
regional
catastrophe
she
said
adding
that
only
the
syrian
people
can
decide
the
presidents
fate
what
we
do
know
is
he
was
raised
in
nearby
bristol
and
that
hes
been
planning
this
for
months
what
we
feel
is
the
sense
of
intensity
passion
and
involvement
what
we
find
is
more
activity
in
the
anxious
brains
kalin
said
what
we
had
to
consider
the
most
was
the
impact

daini

what
we
know
about
the
gunman

sealed
off

around

shortly
after

as
they
sought

piece

with
one
of
those
i
have
many
from
our
early
dating
days
when
motorola
launched
its
pure

moto
x
devices
it
said
android
will
come
largely
untouched
and
updated
accordingly
when
moynihan
opened
the
drivers
side
door
the

shows
west
sprang
out
and
fired
a
shot
with
a
pistol
at
the
officers
face
when
my
child
cuddles
up
to
my
mother
on
the
sofa
happily
talking
to
her
about
her
favorite
books
and
girl
scouts
and
other
things
my
mothers
face
lights
up
when
nearly
developing
countries
come
together
in
brussels
at
the
end
of
june
as
part
of
the
global
partnership
for
education
they
will
be
asked
to
commit
to
increase
education
spending
when
officers
arrived
they
found
a
yearold
man
who
had
been
shot
when
one
of
us
nine
children
would
ask
her
what
was
for
supper
she
would
say
hot
tongue
and
cold
shoulder
when
one
resolves
to
solve
a
personal
problem
one
will
often
see
a
resonant
message
embedded
in
a
moment

other
officers
responded
and
started
to

down

are

‚
especially
when
theyre
here
for
an
interview
which
can
be
stressful
for
people
‚
my
dogs
will
turn
around
and
welcome
them
when
pain
was
not
very
intense
or
involved
the
neck
that
was
also
associated
with
a
lower
likelihood
of
calling
an
ambulance
first
when
pauly
was
discovered
his
rescuers
realized
he
was
in
need
of
serious
help
and
got
in
touch
with
marando
when
people
come
in
and
take
stuff
and
leave
it
kind
of
feels
like
theyre
disrespecting
you

a
way

at

on

when

largely
in
the
windows
of
hair
salons
‚úwhen
people
were
hurting
john
acted
on
it‚
when
police
arrived
on
scene
its
unclear
what
happened
between
them
and
the
suspect
but
it
ended
with
an
officer
shooting
and
killing
the
male
suspect
when
president
obama
took
office
one
of
his
pledges
was
to
try
to
fix
that
when
professors
avoid
their
responsibilities
they
are
putting
students
in
real
danger
when

are

they
are
killed
when

arrived
ecological

when

martin
first
visited
south

years

the
impact
of
the
rats
was
stark
when
reid
lodge
was
years
old
he
faced
a
very
difficult
conversation
with
his
family
and
friends
when
republicans
called
them
death
panels
democrats
quickly
scuttled
the
provision
lending
credence
to
the
republican
claim
that
thats
what
they
were

you
going
to
let
me
go
when
shes
sick
she
wants
it
when
she
started
learning
tseng
was
held
back
by
her
innate
learning
disability
and
was
therefore
a
late
starter
when
she
went
with
her
daughter
a
few
years
ago
she
saw
many
of
the
players
get
picked
up
and
sign
contracts
with
european
teams
when
someone
in
his
or
her
twenties
fresh
out
of
college
believes
they
are
going
to
fix
me
it
means
that
i

dave
matthews
gave
one
of

the
experience
of

when
he
hopped
into

back
of

car
after
his

broke
down
on
his
way
to
a
concert
in
july
when
such

people
who
keep

may
chose
to
not
reveal

about

relationships
between
the

the

in

the

added
when
syrians
hear
i‚m
an
american
they
ask
‚òwhere

when
that
diminution
of
character
occurs
in
a
district
in
which
the
margin
of
contributing
over
noncontributing
structures
and
sites
is
small
the
potential
consequences
of
the
loss
of

are
magnified
when
that
opportunity
came
and
western
health
asked

america
responded

fleeting

not

for

the
plot
looked
like
this
filled
with
nearly
a
metre
of
muddy
water
when
the
game
gets
tight
you
dont
want
to
get
stuck
between
going
up

down
stairs
you
dont
want
to
miss
the
action
when
the
investment
situation
is
linked

increases
the
chances

theres
a
complicated

the

should
be
as
simple
as
possible
when
there‚s
a

the

is
that
you
may
have
to
continue
working

supplement
your
retirement
cut

delay
retirement
altogether

to
look
something
up

when
we
are
better

that
role
for

will
recede‚
when
we
are

about
conflict
or
tragedies
we
always
learn
about
them
in
a
limited
way
when
we
get
that
amount
of
time
it
gets
us
into
the
game
too
and
it
helps
us
for

we
hear
the

of
a
frightened
deer
and
my
guide
kills
the
engine
my
grownup
heart
pounds
once
again
when
we
know
that
theres
issues
brewing
we
try
and
stamp
them
out
before
they
get
to
this
level
when
we
leave
unfair
employers
or
cut
off
contact
with
unsupportive
friends
or
kick
bad
habits
that‚s
seen
as
a
testament
to
personal
growth
‚úwhen
we
saw
what
it
was
really
like
though
and
learned
those
little
kids
had
been
in
there
alone

it
just
breaks
my
heart‚
when
we
stop
saying
it
he
be
will
become
a
dictator
when
we
talk
about
addiction
it
has
been
helpful
for
me
to
understand
it
as
a
disease
when
we
traveled
around
the
country
looking
into
researching
the
epidemic
of
assaults
on
our
campuses
time
and
again
wed
ask
students
what
have
you
heard
on
your
campus
where
is
it
dangerous
when
we
tried
to
encourage
growth
post
end
of

it
was
only

once

remind
us
remember
education
is
the

you
will
ever
carry
when
we
were
working
on
this
hospital
we
knew
we
were
working
on
something
innovative
and
special
and
to
have
this
work
celebrated
is
amazing
when
workers
run
away

from

we
can
see
it
looks
racially
homogenous

the
entire
sorority
system
has
faced
those
issues
and
is
still
addressing
them
with

growing
year
over

yes
i
did

but
i
worked

it

in

it

president

in

yesterdays
mass

was

say
an

coyotes
are

yet
another
was
a

was
proud
of
himself
for

enrolling
at
umpqua
uhmpkwah
community
college
yet
despite
the
uns
efforts
to
be
more
representative
and
inclusive
half
of
humanity
still
remains
excluded
to
this
day
yet
eu
solidarity
is
not
just
being
undermined
by
the
greek
debt
crisis
the
influx
of
thousands
of
migrants
crossing
the
mediterranean
from
north
africa
is
also
playing
its
part
yet
even
as
boehner
sought
to
smooth
things
over
some
outside
conservatives
applied
pressure
for
more
confrontation
yet
even
as
the
company
grew
the
googleplex
remained
appropriated
space
shaped
by
the
architecture
of
its
last
inhabitant
silicon
graphics
yet
even
as
this
anguishing
exodus
has
gripped
international
attention
it
has
obscured
a
connected
and
equally
troubling
pattern
of
rising
religious
extremism
in
myanmar
yet
even
that
key
measure
was
late
yet
godley
takes
us
further
bringing
the
twins
back
onstage
in
a
hilarious
mincing
dance
where
they
prance
around
arm
in
arm
with
their
noses
in
the
air
as
the
white
guy
tries
to
get
them
to
see
him
yet
he
does
accept
that
broadcasting
the
errors
of
others
on
the
internet
is
a
form
of
punishment
yet
he
feels
different
about
the
game
yet
how
many
zoes
actually
exist
in
the
real
world
yet
i
can
not
hide
my
concern
for
the
family
which
is
threatened
perhaps
as
never
before
from
within
and
without
yet
in
a
pop
culture
world
of
full
of
empire
strikes
back
darkness
and
antiheroes
it
was
nice
to
see
trueblue
heroes
having
fun
at

cineplex
again
yet
major
misunderstandings
about
credit
cards
persist
yet
neither
child
had
cancer
yet
neither
debate
covered
the
topic
of
gun
laws
and
access
to
guns
yet
none
of
these
is
used
broadly
enough
to
solve
the
reading
problem
in
highpoverty
schools
yet
not
many
political
tacticians
outside

orbit
believe
that

that
the

‚út√™te
a

is
a
work
built
in
code
yet
the
blues
mood
still
exists
for
people
of
color
yet
the
press
diligently
focuses
its
scorn
on
those
reprehensible
testicleowners
who
sought
sex
with
women
who
arent
their
wives
yet
theres
a
mathematical
formula
at
work
here
two
negatives
make
a
positive
yet
there‚s
one
glass
ceiling
that
remains
stubbornly
resistant
to
cracks
yet
the
separation
from
the
homeland
from
the
readership
from
the
place
where
thomas
mann
felt
at
home
this
is
what
caused
him
such
a
shock
yet
these
two
premises
dont
hold
for
a
classical
black
hole
in
which
the
information
is
permanently
and
irreversibly
lost
as
it
enters
the
black
hole
yet
the
spin
off
is
a
bet
that
blackstones
advisory
business
is
worth
more
on

the

predawn

on
monday
caught
the
afghan
police
and
army
by
surprise
handing
the
group
arguably
its
largest
victory
in
years
of
war
yet
they
contribute
billions
of
dollars
into
our
economy
and
have
among
the
lowest
crime
rate
in
the
country
yet
universities
want
to
have
the
freedom
to
arrange

ways
that
they
want
ehrenberg
says
yet
we
must
not
now
cower
in
fear
and
submission
to
this
new
tyranny
this
expanding
fascism
masquerading
as
religion
yet
when

and

californians
to

by

if

could
have
been
on

someone
decided
you
dont

here
go
back

would
have
suffered
the

humiliation
the

degradation
that
he
has
said
judge
monica

you
could
pay
for
it
privately

most

can
not
afford
it

impoverishment
is
not
something
most
people
will
do
to
themselves
voluntarily
you
could
see
that
it
was
dented
in
the
middle
you
could
tell
the
guy
who
owned
this
guitar
took
his
playing
seriously
his
gear
was
expensive
you
could
use
a
blog
podcast
or
another
medium
to
distribute
your
knowledge
and
ideas
but
make
sure
you
leave
room
for
your
other
interests
so
you
arent
trapped
in

exclusive
area

you
want

be

not

curious
